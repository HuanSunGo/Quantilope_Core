Does anyone know if they've totally discontinued making 574s in the EE Wide size?

I can't seem to find these anywhere anymore.  The NB website and Zappos don't even seem to show it as an option now.

Pretty bummed out if this is the case.  They've become my go-to for the last several years.  And the strange thing is that I really don't have very wide feet.   I've never bought wide for any other shoe. The standard 574s just seem incredibly narrow.  The few dedicated 574 people I know also always go with the EE.  If these are actually discontinued, I'd imagine that's quite a chunk of their sales they'd be abandoning.",1664931628.0

Most of the running shoes that use Fuel Cell are 8mm or under.  With the new Fuel Cell midsole for the v6, I'm wondering if the profile has changed.

I have a pair of 990v2 Teddy Santis that I've worn sparingly around the house.  But after years of wearing shoes like Altras and the More v3 I'm having a really hard time adjusting to high drop sneaker like the v2, and unfortunately I'm just not finding them to be comfortable for me.  I can wear a flat minimalist shoe, so cushion isn't the issue, just the high drop.

Any insights on the v6 are appreciated.  Would also appreciate any recommendations or thoughts on other NB to try instead of the 990v2. On paper, the v6 look the most similar to the NB running shoes I've come to enjoy.",1664668092.0

However I was told on this sub that it's a motion control shoe. Meanwhile, the running shoe store in my area has it listed as a stability shoe. I have no pronation or supination issues. The worker who fitted me at the store told me not to buy them because they're made for pronators and if worn by non-pronators will push your ankle outwards, eventually causing it to supinate.

Jound 990v4 - expensive but versatile,26,xqsg59,Newbalance,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/xqsg59,8,So I‚Äôve seen a few posts recently inquiring about the navy/midnight Jound 990v4 so I thought I would chime in.

The colour scheme is subtle but still original and because it is dark you don‚Äôt have to baby it. I think the toggles are a nice touch too. I really like the v4 silhouette and right now the market isn‚Äôt flooded with V4s. But perhaps the best thing about this shoe is the versatility you can wear it as a black or navy shoe and it almost seems to change colours depending on what you wear it with.,1664409324.0

I am making this post because I wanted to know if someone ever had issues with the Old Skool Vans scrapping the back of your ankle and if so did you have a similar experience with the 272. I love the silhouette of the 272, but I fear I might have a similar experience. I would love to try them out in the store, but I would need to truly wear them to see if this would be an issue.",1664212965.0

I'm looking at the recently released blue 650s because honestly I like mids/highs more than lows and especially since cold seasons are coming up. I just like the look of the 650 more than the 550, and I really love the 550. But this is just personal backstory.

But my question is should I size down for the 650? I went true to size (11.5) for the 550 and they were a little loose to the point where I had to lace them up a little tighter and they felt awkward even though I still like them.

Sometimes mids/highs can have a totally different fit from lows even if you stay true to size. But I've been thinking of going with an 11 instead of an 11.5 for the 650 because of how my 550's fit. 

Anyone who own's both, do they both fit the same despite one being a low and the other being a mid/high? Because for other sneakers that I've owned both lows and highs/mids I found that the fit could be different despite them having the same general sole, heel, and toebox design.",1664047213.0

Received the latest 990v2 ""Sea Salt"" in mid August and after wearing them about 4 times I noticed the front of the sole slightly coming off, not a lot but still annoying on a 220‚Ç¨ shoe. 

Decided to leave a 2 star review on the product page hoping someone would reach out to me to make it up or at least say something... they eventually did but it was something like ""we're sorry to hear you're not happy with your purchase... thanks for your feedback"".

This morning I decided to take initiative and wrote to customer service, after 2 hrs they already replied suggesting a 110‚Ç¨ (50%) refund. ü§© doesn't fix my shoes but at least they proved to be a customer centric brand with great customer support.

I am finally ready to buy my first pair of [Made in USA; Made in UK] New Balance.

I really like the 990v2 in Sea salt with rain cloud but am worried that they wouldn‚Äôt be easy to clean. 

I‚Äôd wear them usually outside (possibly in the rain) (while riding my electric scooter) and inside (I work at a clothing shop).

Legit check 2002R Rain Cloud from GOAT China,1,xio0uu,Newbalance,https://www.reddit.com/r/Newbalance/comments/xio0uu/legit_check_2002r_rain_cloud_from_goat_china/,8,"Pics: https://imgur.com/a/vgushIz

Hi everyone, I just received a pair of 2002R rain cloud that I ordered from GOAT earlier this month and I'm a bit confused. They're manufactured in China, so there doesn't seem to be a lot of information about those pairs on this sub or around the internet in general. I figured I'd post this here to gather some more info from anyone who may have any idea what's going on.

There's two things I've seen that I have concerns about:

1) **092022** manufacture date?? These just got shipped to me last week so how would this be possible?

2) A lot of missing 'distressed' paint from the green area of the midsole as well as the grey area near the front of the shoe.

3) Dots on back of shoe are inconsistent and are cut off too early

4) Lack of definition of indents on the midsole (specifically near the back of the shoe)

With all that being said, I'm thrown off because the actual materials used on the shoe seem consistent with pairs I've seen and the blacklight details seem legit. On top of that, I've seen a couple of posts on this sub from others who have purchased these shoes from GOAT with recent manufacture dates, made in china, and similar details like the missing paint. Does GOAT have access to new pairs? Or are they just this bad at legit checking? 

Any help figuring this out is much appreciated. I'm trying to decide if I should return these to GOAT or not.",1663620008.0

EXCEPT.....

Why introduce an amazing colorway (White with electric teal) for the Standard foot width, but then only offer one color (Black) in the X-Wide (4E) version??

It's like NB doesn't understand consumer demand planning.

People with ""standard""/skinny toe boxes aren't the only ones who want a dope colorway.

They offered a nice white in X-Wide in the V3 last year around this time, but it was only available in a short window (3-4 weeks) before it sold out and never restocked.",1663513414.0

They fit completely different to any Vietnam pair before, as the sole seems to be less angled up + the added Gore-Tex removes the normal padding that is around the inside, meaning they don't fit tight they fit like a 9.6 instead of a 9.5 so downsize wouldn't work.

\+ New Balance Shop Pictures show samples?, [actual pairs](https://imgur.com/a/sKAZPWB) do not come with Gore-Tex written on the Toe Box instead they have a Gore-Tex patch. So you might be able to get a price reduction depending on your consumer protection laws.",1663247596.0

I've got heel spurs (haglund's deformity) which makes shoe selection quite tough for me. As a long term 574 user I've decided to go up in the range to something in the 9xx series.

Ordered the 990v3, and for the most part they fit perfectly, though the heel is just a tad rigid and hard. It's not too bad at all, I could probably put up with it.

And can I just say that the 990v3 is glorious. I've never held and stared at a shoe with fascination and admiration before. It's sooooo nice.

So, I was wondering if there was another shoe in the 9xx series that had a more padded and softer heel? If not, I reckon I *could* put up with the 990v3, but I don't want to risk without asking, especially given the price tag.

Thanks xx",1662799823.0
