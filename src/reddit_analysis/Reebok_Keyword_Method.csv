# PLEASE READ: 
Hello, this is to let you know that your post is up and running.

Since you are selling, please make sure that you [read all rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/sneakermarket/about/rules/) to ensure that your post isn't removed by a moderator.

A few reminders:

1. NO FAKES, ZERO TOLERANCE. If you are caught selling/trading fakes **OF ANY KIND** (sneakers or not), you will be permanently banned **without warning**.

2. Please ensure that you have your items tagged **AND** priced. If not, your post will be removed **without warning**.

3. Only verified users can user their confirmation emails/photos. If you are not verified, please delete your post or a moderator will. To become verified, [create a reference here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SneakerMarketRefs/) and [send us a modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fsneakermarket) once you have 5 confirmed sales.


# AGAIN. ONLY VERIFIED FLAIRED USERS CAN USE EMAIL CONFIRMATION FOR RECENTLY RELEASED SHOES (so no tagged photos necessary).

5. No external links. Links to eBay, Grailed, and similar sites will be removed. Only link those as a reference and not a sale.


*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/sneakermarket) if you have any questions or concerns.*"
