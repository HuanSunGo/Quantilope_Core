Tips for identifying Nike Product,158,47fex4,Nike,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nike/comments/47fex4/tips_for_identifying_nike_product/,1,"Please note that any product from a previous season may be hard to locate. You may be limited to paying collectors type prices on online auction sites. Beware that many products sold on suspect 3rd party sites are counterfeit product.

**Shoes:**

If you have access to the shoe, look behind the tongue or inside the shoe for the size tag. There is a 6 digit code followed by a hyphen and 3 digits representing the model and color. Search Google for ""Nike"" followed by the code and you'll likely find the correct shoe.

I was chatting with a buddy about it and he thinks it's to keep the market hot for them. But what I don't get is why does Nike care about the secondary market for them? They're not making money on it right? There was that one case where the employee's son was making major bank, but she wasn't apart of that from my understanding. 

Why not make it a fair chance for everybody and simply do a pre-order so everybody who wants it can get them. I'm guessing here a lot of bots are winning these draws. I put in my draw the second the Nike Air Penny I Orlando released and still didn't get it. Same thing for the Nike Air Jordan IV Yellow/Dark Grey release.

As background, I am 59 yo, 68KG and a 1:25 Half Marathoner currently.

1. I don't find the weight an issue
2. The shoe is super comfortable, no blisters or hotspots at all.
3. It handles paces so well from Under 4 min/km to a more relaxed 5min/km+

As an example today I did a 32K run at an average of 4:25/Km at a variety of paces, terrains and gradients. Not a hassle at all, I didn't even notice the shoe - except to marvel at its abilities-  it just handles all this with aplomb.

In fact, I did a half a week or so ago in the AlphaFly2 and after today's run I think the ZF5 would have served me better.

I can't run in the Invincible run nor the Infinity Run but this shoe is just sublime.

All I was sent was a vague picture of a box in some carpeted room with no other identifiable info and no shoes in sight. I tried speaking with fedex but didn't get anywhere so I moved on to nike. The support guy was very nice and to my surprise processes an order and sends me a 2nd pair for free + a 10% discount code. I asked if thats the only solution because I really didn't want to wait all over again. I was hoping they could investigate further or maybe speak with whoever delivered them to figure out where they went. But support dude says they (fedex) would most likely just say they delivered it and nothing more. I shrug it off and wait on the 2nd delivery to come. Not even 3 days later there's a box at my door and yep they're the first set that went missing. I assume a neighbor or someone found it and brought it to my address. My question is probably obvious by now so I won't waste anymore time elaborating. should I go back to support, let them know I finally got the shoes, and try to cancel the 2nd pair? They've already shipped so idk what to do if they show up. I don't really want any issues with nike or the post office, and it feels like if i dont say anything it will just seem like I lied.

A very heated review of the Nike Vaporfly next% 2. [Basically a very essential rant],2,xl3zhw,Nike,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nike/comments/xl3zhw/a_very_heated_review_of_the_nike_vaporfly_next_2/,0,"In my opinion, they are great shoes. The Nike Vaporfly's are probably my favorite running shoe, use them every time I'm doing speed work or doing a 5k-8k Race. Extremely responsive, and extremely cushiony, they are the pinnacle of running. Plus, they are breathable as well.

But.....The zoomx foam, while very cushiony, comfortable, and responsive, has the crappiest durability of any running shoe I have ever owned. In the first mile (road running, 6:10 pace) the foam started to peel off on the heel. I mean, like scraped with sandpaper. The rubber on the bottom of the shoe doesn't reach the back of the sole, which is the reason why these shoes lose their foam. Plus, the material protecting the foam doesn't do anything but look good. If you so much as use these on a normal road, you will lose some foam. Meaning that the longevity of this shoe, and your investment into them, might as well be thrown away. Durability is a key factor to any good running shoe, and the nike vaporfly next% 2 doesn't cut it. It's an expensive piece of foam with a carbon fiber plate in it at this point. If you want a fast shoe that will shred PR's in half, buy this shoe. If you want a shoe that can last you a while, don't get this shoe.

I'm surprised that running websites said that this shoe will last 400 miles, when the traditional Pegasus 38 will only last 200. The pegs are much more durable, and longer lasting. These shoes will only last 50 miles if you use them right. They last 500 if you leave them in a box, and you drive in your car and count that as ""mileage.""

I love these shoes, but Nike has to do something about how durable they are. Like extend the rubber on the bottom of the shoe to the back of the sole. That will solve most of the foam problems. (Plus, it won't weigh much more if they are extended) If they just do that, maybe more runners will invest in this shoe, because I usually change running shoes once every year, and I'm going to be struggling to keep them in pristine racing condition.

Thats the end of my rant, Thanks for coming to my ted talk.

Also the recycled one looks pitch black compared to the previous non-recycled model, which has a bit of bluish shade that make it look more expensive. Guess you can't do it with recyclables + costing the same -_-

Nike not posting my review,2,x90f1r,Nike,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nike/comments/x90f1r/nike_not_posting_my_review/,3,"If you're a serious runner, don't buy the Nike Air Zoom Tempo Next%. The shoe lasted me 3 runs until splitting at the sole. Their support team gave me two codes to enter at check out to exchange the pair, but the system only allows one code so it knocked off two day shipping. The system doesn't tell you that they only accept one code. 

Nike support failed to resolve the shipping method. So I'm in the middle of marathon training and have no choice but to use old shoes while I wait for this to get resolved. This has interrupted my training as it's more difficult to complete long runs with my old shoes. So I'm considering buying a pair of running shoes until the replacement pair comes next week. Im not confident the replacement pair will last more than a month. 

When I posted a review with pictures on the Nike site, the review wasn't displayed.

I'll get straight to the point. I used to have this pair of Nikes a few years back (sometime between 2016-2019) that I want to find again. I can't remember their name or else I wouldn't be here. There are a few things about them I remember very distinctly.


1. The Nike swoosh was on the toes as opposed to on the side.


2. The sole is very thin.


3. The design itself is very minimalist. There's not a whole lot going on with it.


The closest I've been able to find are the FS Lite 3s which may actually be what im thinking of but I don't remember the back of the sole being as thick as those ones are. During my searching, I've realized if those are the ones I'm talking about it'd be impossible to find a new pair so any recommendations for anything with a similar lightweight and low profile would be much appreciated.
