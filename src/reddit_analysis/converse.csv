Return/refund question,4,xvoo7w,Converse,https://www.reddit.com/r/Converse/comments/xvoo7w/returnrefund_question/,3,"A little complicated so let me explain. Recently I ordered some chuck 70s. First pair had issues with the stitching so they were returned. I ordered another pair which came and were sadly defective (issues with the toecap etc). I reached out to customer service and they sent me another pair as an exchange which I received probably two weeks ago. I mailed back the original pair from the exchange but once they received it they refunded me for the order. The last “order” (exchange) was mailed out and the receipt shows I paid $0. 

So basically first pair was around $90. They were returned via mail and I was refunded. 

Second pair was $90. Converse exchanged the order and sent me another pair with the receipt showing $0. I sent back the second pair via mail and now have been refunded that $90. 

Did I somehow luck out and get a free pair of converse? Or do y’all think they’ll charge my card sometime down the road?",1664912816.0

my converse wear out so fast. why?,11,xefr3d,Converse,https://www.reddit.com/r/Converse/comments/xefr3d/my_converse_wear_out_so_fast_why/,9,"I bought a pair of black canvas converse around September and by April they were already so worn out they had holes in the bottoms of the shoes. I was hoping that was just a one time experience but I also have a white leather pair I bought around the same time (last September) which also have holes in the bottoms now. I think these ones lasted longer because they took some time to break in being leather

I know converse aren't the most durable but I feel like they should be lasting longer than 7-12 months. I only walk about 5-7k steps a day and I don't do any running nor do I work in the shoes. 

I really like the way converse fit but I don't want to have to buy new ones several times a year. Is there anything I can do for the shoes to last longer or should I just ditch them for something more sturdy?",1663195551.0

[W] Need help finding info/new pair of this color All Star,4,xejeot,Converse,https://www.reddit.com/r/Converse/comments/xejeot/w_need_help_finding_infonew_pair_of_this_color/,5,"For years, I've had this one pair of Converse that I've loved so much, and now they're starting to fall apart badly on me. I haven't seen them since the one time in a JC Penny's or Macy's, and people who I've shown them think I'm insane cause they haven't seen them before.

~~I'm mainly looking to see if anybody knows more info about them, so I can look for them easier, or if anybody has a newer pair that I may buy them off of. Not brand new but something affordable if by some miracle someone also owns this color~~

**EDIT: I know how to find them now but I'm hoping someone here has a pair I could buy from. I really want a pair that isn't falling apart like mine. I don't care much about the condition if it means I don't have to spend an almost retail price for them, but not in the same condition as mine, of course.**

As far as I remember they might've just been 'chocolate mint' but frankly I've also been told they might not be real Converse. I'm certain they are. They're ancient cause I got them when I was 12 I think, so back in 2009.

Cant think I've seen any others with a blue sole, so perhaps unusual.

My friends asked if they are rare/collectable .  When made etc.

He thinks he's had them for maybe 18 plus years, perhaps longer.

Converse Factory Stores: Anyone Else Stunned That...,3,wnrrih,Converse,https://www.reddit.com/r/Converse/comments/wnrrih/converse_factory_stores_anyone_else_stunned_that/,2,"They have no ability to take payments over the phone, transfer shoes between stores, or ship items to customers upon payment?

Found a pair of Chuck 70s that I loved and would have bought on the spot at my local store (Charlotte). They had 50+ pairs, but no sizes above a 10.5. So no dice. 

Called a couple of other outlets to see if I could find my size and just order them. Took 3 calls to find a Team Leader who even knew how to search their system and view the inventory from other stores.

Longish story short, the Charlestown, SC and Williamsburg, VA stores have my size sitting on the shelf, and there's no way for me to buy them short of driving 7++ hours round trip. I debated trying to hire a local courier service to buy and deliver them to the Post Office or a UPS store, but they won't touch the job for fear of a CC charge back after the fact. The stores will not take a payment over the phone in any form. 

Anyone else run into this? I'm just not used to seeing a chain of dozens of retail outlets that seems utterly unconcerned with putting customers first and making sales that take a little extra effort.

""Sorry we didn't have your size, there's a store 4 hours away that does, but there's no way for you to pre-pay and get it transferred here, you'll have to make the drive there to pick them up in person.""

Seems a bit bizarre in 2022, or are my expectations just out of line? I've been told so many different things on the 4-5 phone calls I made I think some of the store managers may not know their own store policies. Who knows...

Chuck 70s fit?,3,wn7ego,Converse,https://www.reddit.com/r/Converse/comments/wn7ego/chuck_70s_fit/,5,"Many many moons ago I wore regular Chuck Taylors.  Then I got old and lo and behold the Chuck II’s came out, and I LOVED them due to their support.

I haven’t tried any Cons since.  I keep seeing the Chuck 70s being touted.

How is the fit on them?  I tried some Converse on a few years ago that I THOUGHT were the 70s and they were pretty narrow.  Now I see online they come in a wide fit?

I’m just curious I guess how they fit over all compared to the OG Converse and more recently the Chuck IIs?

Truly amazing pair- with one problem: the right insole doesn't fit well. I checked them over, and the right insole is badly molded- its noticeably higher compared to the normal fitting left one.

Unfortunately, I realized this too late- I've worn the pair too much to return. What I need is to get an insole for the right shoe- where do I get something like this? Would it be a better idea to just get a really cheap pair used or on sale and rip out the insole and replace it? (And as a side note, are low top insoles the same as high top insoles?)

I really like the monochrome version because it looks really clean with the pure black and white.

The classic combo would be cool too, but I don’t like how the black one has a black outline on the top and the white one has a red outline.

Is it worth going up half a size?,3,wgsocf,Converse,https://www.reddit.com/r/Converse/comments/wgsocf/is_it_worth_going_up_half_a_size/,2,"Hey everyone,

I’m a low top Converse person for weightlifting functionality and I’ve been a consistent 7M/9W in Chuck 70s which is a full size down from my regular shoe size. The 10W was massive and I was slipping out. A 9W is totally fine, maybe a little uncomfortable if I’m walking long distances which is the case with all flat shoes.  

I’ve gotten into high tops for style, and I assumed the same size would be fine but fuck they hurt. I spent a day breaking them in and my heels bled like a bitch and the toebox is so narrow. It honestly looks stupid because to get the laces tight enough to be comfortable, the shape of the shoe looks incredibly deformed. The toebox looks tiny and the laced portion looks wider. I don’t have particularly wide feet, just average ones and I hate the way they look so I never wear them. Typically they don’t sell half sizes in Aus but I’m paying extra for a pair on GOAT so I want them to be comfortable.

Is it worth going 0.5 size up for extra wiggle room?",1659697763.0

so i want to buy my first pair of converse and tbh im very indesicive (no idea how to spell that). im pretty short (155cm, 5'1) and im pretty set on getting the high tops just because i like the design more. i dont have necessarily long or short legs, id say average but still unsure.

now on the website you're able to choose between the ""normal"" chuck taylor and the chuck 70s vintage canvas and im very torn. because i hate when shoes are like so white they literally glow in the sun but i cant justify paying 15€ more just for an off white. so is it worth ot or will the ""normal"" chuck taylor turn off white with use anyway.

and lastly, i usually wear a size 36 (EU) but according to the website (my feet are 24cm from heel to big toe but idk which toe actually counts) i would need a 39 (EU).

(tldr)
1. how high are the high tops from sole to the highest part?
2. would they make my legs look short (im 155cm 5'1 'average' legs?
3. are the off white vintage canvas worth it or will the 'normal' chuck taylor turn yellowy with use anyway?

- Also this is really random but i don't necessarily care if the high tops are tooo high because im gonna wear long jeans anyways and i think they look cute on shorts. (also idk who said it but skinny jeans aren't the only jeans to look good with converse)-",1659241891.0

I love Converse shoes so much and just want to know if they're a worthy investment in general or if it's kinda dependent on where you are in the world if that makes sense.",1658779777.0

I hope this is ok to post here - I wanna get some platform chucks, but I'm a size 12/13 (really a 12 wide but in normal converse that means I've needed a 13). I've found previously when I got platform docs that because the sole thickness of the same from like size 3 to size 13, the proportions of the shoe looks way different in size 13 than in pictures which are more normal sizes.

So basically I was just wondering if anyone with the regular platform chucks in these sizes had a picture to share? (I did search the sub but didn't find anything!)

Converse - My Rick Owens Customs,9,vtuzt0,Converse,https://www.reddit.com/r/Converse/comments/vtuzt0/converse_my_rick_owens_customs/,3,"So I recently got Converse that look super close to the Rick Owens shoes, and people mistake my shoes for Rick Owens and other people just give me weird stares.

I customized my Converse to the point where they looked somewhat like the reference image below, with the identical looking fabric and NOT missing the small details. While there are some things I can't change, like the size of the toe tip or how high the ""high-top"" can go past your ankles, or add a zipper on the side, I think it looks pretty neat. I just need longer shoe laces for a wrap around, because I like styling my converse that way.  


My Regular Converse | The fabric is not sturdy, it's like paper. The shoe is black but I somtimes mistake it for dark blue. The shoe laces are long. The toe cap is the same as my custom converse, not a big deal. The stiching is white and I hate that. The star is white, I hated that so I wore long pants so I could hide the big ol' star. The bottom is flattened. 

My Converse Custom | The fabric that holds the ""shoe"" part up (I don't know what it's called) is sturdy and isn't loose like the regular Converse. Shoe laces are shorter than Rick Owens ramones and my other normal pair Converse.Of course they don't have the zipper. The shoes do not go up to your upper ankle. The bottom is flattened. No stitching at the bottom. The holes for the shoe laces are silver. The color is BLACK. The stitching that goes throughout the shoe is black, to match up the Rick Owens esk look. The star is black, which is basically barely see-able.

Rick Owens Ramones | The toe cap isn't curved, the shoe goes past your ankles, the bottom of the shoe is jittered, there's stitching at the bottom. There's a zipper on the side. The holes for the shoe laces are silver. The color is BLACK (same level as my converse customs)

Any thoughts on CONVERSE x Rick Owens Ramones customs?
