If you have not read these, stop and do so now. Here\\'s a condensed list that is absolutely essential to read before you move any further.\\n\\n* Rule 1: DO NOT accept PMs without a public comment on GCX! Open your post and ensure you can see the comment. If you can\\'t, don\\'t engage with the user as they may be attempting to trick you by disguising a PM as a public comment. Was your post removed and someone immediately sent you a private message? Don\\'t talk with them! Search the [**Universal Scammer List**](https://universalscammerlist.com/search.php). Did you receive a PM from modmail saying you can\\'t sell the gift card on the sub, but you can sell it to the mod team? This is a scam! The mods of /r/giftcardexchange will never offer this \"service\" or ask you to reveal gift card information! Click on the sub name - it\\'s likely a private sub named \"gitfcardexchange\" or \"giftcardexcharge\" attempting to impersonate the real /r/giftcardexchange.\\n* Rule 2: Investigate your trading partner! Is the account very inactive? Did they just become active and immediately start posting on trade subs? Are they trying to direct you off of Reddit to another site? These are red flags! Double check any links you\\'re sent and ensure they aren\\'t leading to a different domain outside of Reddit.\\n* Rules 4 and 5: Are you attempting to trade an account balance such as Amazon gift card balance over $250 in value? Are you attempting to trade a single gift card or multiple gift cards over $250 in value? Stop and see the appropriate rule and send in the form to modmail, otherwise your post will be removed and you\\'ll receive an infraction.\\n* Rule 6: Do you have a prepaid card such as Visa? These cannot be traded for cash equivalents such as PayPal here! GCX is for trading gift cards - see /r/Cash4Cash if it is more appropriate.\\n* Rule 11: Are you selling a gift card? If you\\'re a ``GCX Beginner`` you can only ask for PayPal Goods & Services! Asking for any other payment method (not including gift cards) will lead to a post removal.\\n\\n\\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Here\\'s a condensed list that is absolutely essential to read before you move any further.\\n\\n* Rule 1: DO NOT accept PMs without a public comment on GCX! Open your post and ensure you can see the comment. If you can\\'t, don\\'t engage with the user as they may be attempting to trick you by disguising a PM as a public comment. Was your post removed and someone immediately sent you a private message? Don\\'t talk with them! Search the [**Universal Scammer List**](https://universalscammerlist.com/search.php). Did you receive a PM from modmail saying you can\\'t sell the gift card on the sub, but you can sell it to the mod team? This is a scam! The mods of /r/giftcardexchange will never offer this \"service\" or ask you to reveal gift card information! Click on the sub name - it\\'s likely a private sub named \"gitfcardexchange\" or \"giftcardexcharge\" attempting to impersonate the real /r/giftcardexchange.\\n* Rule 2: Investigate your trading partner! Is the account very inactive? Did they just become active and immediately start posting on trade subs? Are they trying to direct you off of Reddit to another site? These are red flags! Double check any links you\\'re sent and ensure they aren\\'t leading to a different domain outside of Reddit.\\n* Rules 4 and 5: Are you attempting to trade an account balance such as Amazon gift card balance over $250 in value? Are you attempting to trade a single gift card or multiple gift cards over $250 in value? Stop and see the appropriate rule and send in the form to modmail, otherwise your post will be removed and you\\'ll receive an infraction.\\n* Rule 6: Do you have a prepaid card such as Visa? These cannot be traded for cash equivalents such as PayPal here! GCX is for trading gift cards - see /r/Cash4Cash if it is more appropriate.\\n* Rule 11: Are you selling a gift card? If you\\'re a ``GCX Beginner`` you can only ask for PayPal Goods & Services! Asking for any other payment method (not including gift cards) will lead to a post removal.\\n\\n\\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/giftcardexchange) if you have any questions or concerns.*',\n",
              " 'Due to increased scam attempts within the sub, all low-flaired **sellers** (< 11 Trades) must follow several new procedures for increased security. [THIS MEANS YOU.](https://i.imgur.com/LF6yZsE.jpg)  \\n\\n1. **All items must include a** ***handwritten*** **timestamp with your username and the current date included in at least one picture that shows all items listed for sale to show proof of ownership.** Additional pictures can be included in the album for increased detail. \\n2.

If you have not read these, stop and do so now. Here\\'s a condensed list that is absolutely essential to read before you move any further.\\n\\n* Rule 1: DO NOT accept PMs without a public comment on GCX! Open your post and ensure you can see the comment. If you can\\'t, don\\'t engage with the user as they may be attempting to trick you by disguising a PM as a public comment. Was your post removed and someone immediately sent you a private message? Don\\'t talk with them! Search the [**Universal Scammer List**](https://universalscammerlist.com/search.php). Did you receive a PM from modmail saying you can\\'t sell the gift card on the sub, but you can sell it to the mod team? This is a scam! The mods of /r/giftcardexchange will never offer this \"service\" or ask you to reveal gift card information! Click on the sub name - it\\'s likely a private sub named \"gitfcardexchange\" or \"giftcardexcharge\" attempting to impersonate the real /r/giftcardexchange.\\n* Rule 2: Investigate your trading partner! Is the account very inactive? Did they just become active and immediately start posting on trade subs? Are they trying to direct you off of Reddit to another site? These are red flags! Double check any links you\\'re sent and ensure they aren\\'t leading to a different domain outside of Reddit.\\n* Rules 4 and 5: Are you attempting to trade an account balance such as Amazon gift card balance over $250 in value? Are you attempting to trade a single gift card or multiple gift cards over $250 in value? Stop and see the appropriate rule and send in the form to modmail, otherwise your post will be removed and you\\'ll receive an infraction.\\n* Rule 6: Do you have a prepaid card such as Visa? These cannot be traded for cash equivalents such as PayPal here! GCX is for trading gift cards - see /r/Cash4Cash if it is more appropriate.\\n* Rule 11: Are you selling a gift card? If you\\'re a ``GCX Beginner`` you can only ask for PayPal Goods & Services! Asking for any other payment method (not including gift cards) will lead to a post removal.\\n\\n\\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

The mods of /r/giftcardexchange will never offer this \"service\" or ask you to reveal gift card information! Click on the sub name - it\\'s likely a private sub named \"gitfcardexchange\" or \"giftcardexcharge\" attempting to impersonate the real /r/giftcardexchange.\\n* Rule 2: Investigate your trading partner! Is the account very inactive? Did they just become active and immediately start posting on trade subs? Are they trying to direct you off of Reddit to another site? These are red flags! Double check any links you\\'re sent and ensure they aren\\'t leading to a different domain outside of Reddit.\\n* Rules 4 and 5: Are you attempting to trade an account balance such as Amazon gift card balance over $250 in value? Are you attempting to trade a single gift card or multiple gift cards over $250 in value? Stop and see the appropriate rule and send in the form to modmail, otherwise your post will be removed and you\\'ll receive an infraction.\\n* Rule 6: Do you have a prepaid card such as Visa? These cannot be traded for cash equivalents such as PayPal here! GCX is for trading gift cards - see /r/Cash4Cash if it is more appropriate.\\n* Rule 11: Are you selling a gift card? If you\\'re a ``GCX Beginner`` you can only ask for PayPal Goods & Services! Asking for any other payment method (not including gift cards) will lead to a post removal.\\n\\n\\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Double check any links you\\'re sent and ensure they aren\\'t leading to a different domain outside of Reddit.\\n* Rules 4 and 5: Are you attempting to trade an account balance such as Amazon gift card balance over $250 in value? Are you attempting to trade a single gift card or multiple gift cards over $250 in value? Stop and see the appropriate rule and send in the form to modmail, otherwise your post will be removed and you\\'ll receive an infraction.\\n* Rule 6: Do you have a prepaid card such as Visa? These cannot be traded for cash equivalents such as PayPal here! GCX is for trading gift cards - see /r/Cash4Cash if it is more appropriate.\\n* Rule 11: Are you selling a gift card?

If you have not read these, stop and do so now. Here\\'s a condensed list that is absolutely essential to read before you move any further.\\n\\n* Rule 1: DO NOT accept PMs without a public comment on GCX! Open your post and ensure you can see the comment. If you can\\'t, don\\'t engage with the user as they may be attempting to trick you by disguising a PM as a public comment. Was your post removed and someone immediately sent you a private message? Don\\'t talk with them! Search the [**Universal Scammer List**](https://universalscammerlist.com/search.php). Did you receive a PM from modmail saying you can\\'t sell the gift card on the sub, but you can sell it to the mod team? This is a scam! The mods of /r/giftcardexchange will never offer this \"service\" or ask you to reveal gift card information! Click on the sub name - it\\'s likely a private sub named \"gitfcardexchange\" or \"giftcardexcharge\" attempting to impersonate the real /r/giftcardexchange.\\n* Rule 2: Investigate your trading partner! Is the account very inactive? Did they just become active and immediately start posting on trade subs? Are they trying to direct you off of Reddit to another site? These are red flags! Double check any links you\\'re sent and ensure they aren\\'t leading to a different domain outside of Reddit.\\n* Rules 4 and 5: Are you attempting to trade an account balance such as Amazon gift card balance over $250 in value? Are you attempting to trade a single gift card or multiple gift cards over $250 in value? Stop and see the appropriate rule and send in the form to modmail, otherwise your post will be removed and you\\'ll receive an infraction.\\n* Rule 6: Do you have a prepaid card such as Visa? These cannot be traded for cash equivalents such as PayPal here! GCX is for trading gift cards - see /r/Cash4Cash if it is more appropriate.\\n* Rule 11: Are you selling a gift card? If you\\'re a ``GCX Beginner`` you can only ask for PayPal Goods & Services! Asking for any other payment method (not including gift cards) will lead to a post removal.\\n\\n\\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Double check any links you\\'re sent and ensure they aren\\'t leading to a different domain outside of Reddit.\\n* Rules 4 and 5: Are you attempting to trade an account balance such as Amazon gift card balance over $250 in value? Are you attempting to trade a single gift card or multiple gift cards over $250 in value? Stop and see the appropriate rule and send in the form to modmail, otherwise your post will be removed and you\\'ll receive an infraction.\\n* Rule 6: Do you have a prepaid card such as Visa? These cannot be traded for cash equivalents such as PayPal here! GCX is for trading gift cards - see /r/Cash4Cash if it is more appropriate.\\n* Rule 11: Are you selling a gift card?

If you have not read these, stop and do so now. Here\\'s a condensed list that is absolutely essential to read before you move any further.\\n\\n* Rule 1: DO NOT accept PMs without a public comment on GCX! Open your post and ensure you can see the comment. If you can\\'t, don\\'t engage with the user as they may be attempting to trick you by disguising a PM as a public comment. Was your post removed and someone immediately sent you a private message? Don\\'t talk with them! Search the [**Universal Scammer List**](https://universalscammerlist.com/search.php). Did you receive a PM from modmail saying you can\\'t sell the gift card on the sub, but you can sell it to the mod team? This is a scam! The mods of /r/giftcardexchange will never offer this \"service\" or ask you to reveal gift card information! Click on the sub name - it\\'s likely a private sub named \"gitfcardexchange\" or \"giftcardexcharge\" attempting to impersonate the real /r/giftcardexchange.\\n* Rule 2: Investigate your trading partner! Is the account very inactive? Did they just become active and immediately start posting on trade subs? Are they trying to direct you off of Reddit to another site? These are red flags! Double check any links you\\'re sent and ensure they aren\\'t leading to a different domain outside of Reddit.\\n* Rules 4 and 5: Are you attempting to trade an account balance such as Amazon gift card balance over $250 in value? Are you attempting to trade a single gift card or multiple gift cards over $250 in value? Stop and see the appropriate rule and send in the form to modmail, otherwise your post will be removed and you\\'ll receive an infraction.\\n* Rule 6: Do you have a prepaid card such as Visa? These cannot be traded for cash equivalents such as PayPal here! GCX is for trading gift cards - see /r/Cash4Cash if it is more appropriate.\\n* Rule 11: Are you selling a gift card? If you\\'re a ``GCX Beginner`` you can only ask for PayPal Goods & Services! Asking for any other payment method (not including gift cards) will lead to a post removal.\\n\\n\\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
