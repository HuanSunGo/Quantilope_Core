Series 3 Nike edition space grey 42mm Apple Watch in good working and cosmetic condition. WatchOS 8.7.1. Small round ding on lower left corner of case and some very small hairline scratches on the screen that are very hard to notice and photograph. Works fine, holds a charge all day. Battery health says 99%. Comes with original box, aftermarket sport strap, and the USB charging puck/cable. **$80 shipped CONUS**

1st gen Apple watch SE 44mm space grey with broken glass. WatchOS 9.0. Screen still looks good and touch works. This fell flat on a tile floor from waist high and shattered. Good for a glass replacement if you know how to do that. Comes with original packaging only. No strap or charging puck/cable. Battery health 99%. **60 shipped CONUS**

Take both for $120 shipped CONUS

Repairs: None

**Body:**

Hey all, posting up my titanium Series 5. Nothing wrong with it, just upgrading to the Ultra with the funds from selling this one.

Owned for a little over a year, battery is at 83%, I would say I use it an average amount and get easily the full day with it. No damage or blemishes on the screen or body.

Comes with the black Nike strap pictured, somehow lost the Apple sport strap on a beach vacation. Boxes and charger included.

Asking $320 shipped

**Title:** [USA-NC] [H] series 7 45mm stainless steel Cellular Apple Watch in Graphite [W] Paypal

**Username:** /u/Wassindabox

**Body:**

 

For Sale,

Apple Watch Series 7 45mm Stainless Steel Graphite

Running iOS 9.0

Battery Maximum Capacity 97%

Including Apple Watch USB charger

The watch body itself is in fantastic condition as to be expected of a stainless steel model (no scratches that I can see). I did my best to take images of all sides of the device so you can see the condition.

I have a white Nike sports band attached to the watch which, I won't lie, is not in the best condition (there's discoloration on the band/ see images)

I got lucky and my local Apple Store had the Ultras in stock so I splurged and now I'm sitting on this one.

 Repairs: None 

**Asking $525 via Paypal G&S shipped via 2 day priority mail**

I'm looking to sell my ‘Space Grey’ 40mm Apple Watch. The Apple Watch is from series 4 and runs WatchOS 9.0 buttery smooth. The Battery Health of the watch is still in great condition scoring a 97%, guaranteeing a full day's worth of battery life! The Apple Watch has a scratch within the bottom left corner of the display however it is not as noticeable. The Apple Watch will come with its original charging cable and also a lightly used Black Nike Sport Loop (bought from the Apple Store).

Repairs: None

I am asking $115, shipping will be covered by me for anyone within the United States.

If you have not read these, stop and do so now. Here's a condensed list that is absolutely essential to read before you move any further.

* Rule 1: DO NOT accept PMs without a public comment on GCX! Open your post and ensure you can see the comment. If you can't, don't engage with the user as they may be attempting to trick you by disguising a PM as a public comment. Was your post removed and someone immediately sent you a private message? Don't talk with them! Search the [**Universal Scammer List**](https://universalscammerlist.com/search.php). Did you receive a PM from modmail saying you can't sell the gift card on the sub, but you can sell it to the mod team? This is a scam! The mods of /r/giftcardexchange will never offer this ""service"" or ask you to reveal gift card information! Click on the sub name - it's likely a private sub named ""gitfcardexchange"" or ""giftcardexcharge"" attempting to impersonate the real /r/giftcardexchange.
* Rule 2: Investigate your trading partner! Is the account very inactive? Did they just become active and immediately start posting on trade subs? Are they trying to direct you off of Reddit to another site? These are red flags! Double check any links you're sent and ensure they aren't leading to a different domain outside of Reddit.
* Rules 4 and 5: Are you attempting to trade an account balance such as Amazon gift card balance over $250 in value? Are you attempting to trade a single gift card or multiple gift cards over $250 in value? Stop and see the appropriate rule and send in the form to modmail, otherwise your post will be removed and you'll receive an infraction.
* Rule 6: Do you have a prepaid card such as Visa? These cannot be traded for cash equivalents such as PayPal here! GCX is for trading gift cards - see /r/Cash4Cash if it is more appropriate.
* Rule 11: Are you selling a gift card? If you're a ``GCX Beginner`` you can only ask for PayPal Goods & Services! Asking for any other payment method (not including gift cards) will lead to a post removal.

If you have not read these, stop and do so now. Here's a condensed list that is absolutely essential to read before you move any further.

* Rule 1: DO NOT accept PMs without a public comment on GCX! Open your post and ensure you can see the comment. If you can't, don't engage with the user as they may be attempting to trick you by disguising a PM as a public comment. Was your post removed and someone immediately sent you a private message? Don't talk with them! Search the [**Universal Scammer List**](https://universalscammerlist.com/search.php). Did you receive a PM from modmail saying you can't sell the gift card on the sub, but you can sell it to the mod team? This is a scam! The mods of /r/giftcardexchange will never offer this ""service"" or ask you to reveal gift card information! Click on the sub name - it's likely a private sub named ""gitfcardexchange"" or ""giftcardexcharge"" attempting to impersonate the real /r/giftcardexchange.
* Rule 2: Investigate your trading partner! Is the account very inactive? Did they just become active and immediately start posting on trade subs? Are they trying to direct you off of Reddit to another site? These are red flags! Double check any links you're sent and ensure they aren't leading to a different domain outside of Reddit.
* Rules 4 and 5: Are you attempting to trade an account balance such as Amazon gift card balance over $250 in value? Are you attempting to trade a single gift card or multiple gift cards over $250 in value? Stop and see the appropriate rule and send in the form to modmail, otherwise your post will be removed and you'll receive an infraction.
* Rule 6: Do you have a prepaid card such as Visa? These cannot be traded for cash equivalents such as PayPal here! GCX is for trading gift cards - see /r/Cash4Cash if it is more appropriate.
* Rule 11: Are you selling a gift card? If you're a ``GCX Beginner`` you can only ask for PayPal Goods & Services! Asking for any other payment method (not including gift cards) will lead to a post removal.

1. **All items must include a** ***handwritten*** **timestamp with your username and the current date included in at least one picture that shows all items listed for sale to show proof of ownership.** Additional pictures can be included in the album for increased detail. 
2. Payment method is limited to Paypal Goods and Services. Any other method (e.g. Venmo, Zelle, Cashapp, Paypal Friends and Family, et al) is prohibited **unless** you secure the services of a [Payment Proxy Member](https://www.reddit.com/r/GunAccessoriesForSale/wiki/proxy). Failure to adhere to this will result in the buyer being banned for 30 days and seller being banned for 90 days. Additionally, to make things as simple as possible, simply state whether or not the G&S fees are included in your listed price(s). 

If your post is not in compliance with these rules, you may be banned.  Do not make a new posting, **edit this posting** to ensure it complies, or you may be banned.

**Title:** [USA-FL] [H] Apple Watch Series 5 Aluminum GPS 44mm [W] Local Cash/Paypal

**Username:** /u/KDao18

**Body:**

Looking to find this Apple Watch Series 5 a new home. Recently decided to upgrade so this will not be on my wrist much longer.

Battery still lasts well. Standing at 84% Battery Health! Screen has been protected by a plastic screen protector since Day 1. So the screen is still flawless! Minimal damage to the casing.

I will include the original packaging as well as the charger and cables. A discontinued lemon yellow band I bought directly from Apple at the time will be included. However, you can also elect for a Nike+ White Sport Band from when I had a Series 3 42mm. S/M OR M/L on both bands will be included.

GPS only watch. No cellular.

$200 for local (34787 to be exact). Or $225 for shipping. PM for serious inquiries.

**Title:** [USA-CA][H]New Apple Watch Series 6 40mm GPS Midnight Blue w/ extras. Like New 42mm Space Black Link Bracelet [W]Paypal

**Username:** /u/alanderp

**Body:**

Hey all, I have 2 things up for sale.

1. Apple Watch Series 6 40mm in Midnight Blue GPS Pristine/ Mint. This was purchased last year for my dad strictly for the fall detection feature, but it was never used because my dad was not into technology like that. This will come with the original Deep Navy Sport band in the first photo + the black Nike Sport Loop in the photos. The bands have been fitted but the watch itself was never used. Battery health is at 100%. $220 Shipped in the CONUS.
2. 42mm Space Black Link Bracelet Pristine/ Mint - This also fits 44mm and 45mm Apple Watches. Picked this up for formal occasions but only used it once. I prefer the sport loops and bands. $190 Shipped in the CONUS.

Photos - [https://imgur.com/a/tdUEMrh](https://imgur.com/a/tdUEMrh)

Repairs: None

Can provide additional photos upon request.

I'd ask for pictures from a better/lower angle to be able to determine that embroidery is lined up properly. Specifically- I'd check that left shoe.

Edit: Have a few downvotes. Trust, I don’t RL shoes for minor flaws. [I would say that this is not a minor flaw.](https://ibb.co/1Lx7NXR) I also returned two more pairs of VT batch for embroidery that was identical to this. Have bought several pairs of VT batch and it’s great quality."

Since you are selling, please make sure that you [read all rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/sneakermarket/about/rules/) to ensure that your post isn't removed by a moderator.

A few reminders:

1. NO FAKES, ZERO TOLERANCE. If you are caught selling/trading fakes **OF ANY KIND** (sneakers or not), you will be permanently banned **without warning**.

2. Please ensure that you have your items tagged **AND** priced. If not, your post will be removed **without warning**.

3. Only verified users can user their confirmation emails/photos. If you are not verified, please delete your post or a moderator will. To become verified, [create a reference here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SneakerMarketRefs/) and [send us a modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fsneakermarket) once you have 5 confirmed sales.

If you have not read these, stop and do so now. Here's a condensed list that is absolutely essential to read before you move any further.

* Rule 1: DO NOT accept PMs without a public comment on GCX! Open your post and ensure you can see the comment. If you can't, don't engage with the user as they may be attempting to trick you by disguising a PM as a public comment. Was your post removed and someone immediately sent you a private message? Don't talk with them! Search the [**Universal Scammer List**](https://universalscammerlist.com/search.php). Did you receive a PM from modmail saying you can't sell the gift card on the sub, but you can sell it to the mod team? This is a scam! The mods of /r/giftcardexchange will never offer this ""service"" or ask you to reveal gift card information! Click on the sub name - it's likely a private sub named ""gitfcardexchange"" or ""giftcardexcharge"" attempting to impersonate the real /r/giftcardexchange.
* Rule 2: Investigate your trading partner! Is the account very inactive? Did they just become active and immediately start posting on trade subs? Are they trying to direct you off of Reddit to another site? These are red flags! Double check any links you're sent and ensure they aren't leading to a different domain outside of Reddit.
* Rules 4 and 5: Are you attempting to trade an account balance such as Amazon gift card balance over $250 in value? Are you attempting to trade a single gift card or multiple gift cards over $250 in value? Stop and see the appropriate rule and send in the form to modmail, otherwise your post will be removed and you'll receive an infraction.
* Rule 6: Do you have a prepaid card such as Visa? These cannot be traded for cash equivalents such as PayPal here! GCX is for trading gift cards - see /r/Cash4Cash if it is more appropriate.
* Rule 11: Are you selling a gift card? If you're a ``GCX Beginner`` you can only ask for PayPal Goods & Services! Asking for any other payment method (not including gift cards) will lead to a post removal.

If you have not read these, stop and do so now. Here's a condensed list that is absolutely essential to read before you move any further.

* Rule 1: DO NOT accept PMs without a public comment on GCX! Open your post and ensure you can see the comment. If you can't, don't engage with the user as they may be attempting to trick you by disguising a PM as a public comment. Was your post removed and someone immediately sent you a private message? Don't talk with them! Search the [**Universal Scammer List**](https://universalscammerlist.com/search.php). Did you receive a PM from modmail saying you can't sell the gift card on the sub, but you can sell it to the mod team? This is a scam! The mods of /r/giftcardexchange will never offer this ""service"" or ask you to reveal gift card information! Click on the sub name - it's likely a private sub named ""gitfcardexchange"" or ""giftcardexcharge"" attempting to impersonate the real /r/giftcardexchange.
* Rule 2: Investigate your trading partner! Is the account very inactive? Did they just become active and immediately start posting on trade subs? Are they trying to direct you off of Reddit to another site? These are red flags! Double check any links you're sent and ensure they aren't leading to a different domain outside of Reddit.
* Rules 4 and 5: Are you attempting to trade an account balance such as Amazon gift card balance over $250 in value? Are you attempting to trade a single gift card or multiple gift cards over $250 in value? Stop and see the appropriate rule and send in the form to modmail, otherwise your post will be removed and you'll receive an infraction.
* Rule 6: Do you have a prepaid card such as Visa? These cannot be traded for cash equivalents such as PayPal here! GCX is for trading gift cards - see /r/Cash4Cash if it is more appropriate.
* Rule 11: Are you selling a gift card? If you're a ``GCX Beginner`` you can only ask for PayPal Goods & Services! Asking for any other payment method (not including gift cards) will lead to a post removal.

A few reminders:

1. NO FAKES, ZERO TOLERANCE. If you are caught selling/trading fakes **OF ANY KIND** (sneakers or not), you will be permanently banned **without warning**.

2. Please ensure that you have your items tagged **AND** priced. If not, your post will be removed **without warning**.

3. Only verified users can user their confirmation emails/photos. If you are not verified, please delete your post or a moderator will.

Please edit your post to add some paragraph breaks by placing a blank line between distinct sections; it can also be helpful to use bullet points. It's also worth considering how much of the information in your post is crucial context for your legal question, and what can be removed without losing anything important.

Your post has **not** been removed and you are not breaking any rules, however you should note that as mentioned you may receive fewer replies if your post is hard to read.

If you have not read these, stop and do so now. Here's a condensed list that is absolutely essential to read before you move any further.

* Rule 1: DO NOT accept PMs without a public comment on GCX! Open your post and ensure you can see the comment. If you can't, don't engage with the user as they may be attempting to trick you by disguising a PM as a public comment. Was your post removed and someone immediately sent you a private message? Don't talk with them! Search the [**Universal Scammer List**](https://universalscammerlist.com/search.php). Did you receive a PM from modmail saying you can't sell the gift card on the sub, but you can sell it to the mod team? This is a scam! The mods of /r/giftcardexchange will never offer this ""service"" or ask you to reveal gift card information! Click on the sub name - it's likely a private sub named ""gitfcardexchange"" or ""giftcardexcharge"" attempting to impersonate the real /r/giftcardexchange.
* Rule 2: Investigate your trading partner! Is the account very inactive? Did they just become active and immediately start posting on trade subs? Are they trying to direct you off of Reddit to another site? These are red flags! Double check any links you're sent and ensure they aren't leading to a different domain outside of Reddit.
* Rules 4 and 5: Are you attempting to trade an account balance such as Amazon gift card balance over $250 in value? Are you attempting to trade a single gift card or multiple gift cards over $250 in value? Stop and see the appropriate rule and send in the form to modmail, otherwise your post will be removed and you'll receive an infraction.
* Rule 6: Do you have a prepaid card such as Visa? These cannot be traded for cash equivalents such as PayPal here! GCX is for trading gift cards - see /r/Cash4Cash if it is more appropriate.
* Rule 11: Are you selling a gift card? If you're a ``GCX Beginner`` you can only ask for PayPal Goods & Services! Asking for any other payment method (not including gift cards) will lead to a post removal.

**Title:** [USA-NY] [H] Airpods Pro with Magsafe, Apple Watch SE 44 MM GPS [W] Local Cash, Paypal G&S

**Username:** /u/TonyStark826

**Body:**

Hi,

Moved out of the Apple ecosystem recently. Looking to sell the following two items:

1. Apple Watch SE 44 MM Nike edition Black GPS only- Bought last year. Is in very good condition, barely any scratches. . I have only the M/L band and a Solo loop size 6 which will come along. No Box. Repairs: none 
2. Airpods Pro latest version with Magsafe Charging Case: I bought these new but have used them barely for 20-30 hours. Pristine condition, comes with a Spigen cover for the case . Repairs: none

Local pickup is NYC. I prefer to sell them together and the price is 260 $ for the bundle. I can ship for 270 $ in the US as well. But local would be preferred.

I have a trade here, and some more on r/GameSale

If you have not read these, stop and do so now. Here's a condensed list that is absolutely essential to read before you move any further.

* Rule 1: DO NOT accept PMs without a public comment on GCX! Open your post and ensure you can see the comment. If you can't, don't engage with the user as they may be attempting to trick you by disguising a PM as a public comment. Was your post removed and someone immediately sent you a private message? Don't talk with them! Search the [**Universal Scammer List**](https://universalscammerlist.com/search.php). Did you receive a PM from modmail saying you can't sell the gift card on the sub, but you can sell it to the mod team? This is a scam! The mods of /r/giftcardexchange will never offer this ""service"" or ask you to reveal gift card information! Click on the sub name - it's likely a private sub named ""gitfcardexchange"" or ""giftcardexcharge"" attempting to impersonate the real /r/giftcardexchange.
* Rule 2: Investigate your trading partner! Is the account very inactive? Did they just become active and immediately start posting on trade subs? Are they trying to direct you off of Reddit to another site? These are red flags! Double check any links you're sent and ensure they aren't leading to a different domain outside of Reddit.
* Rules 4 and 5: Are you attempting to trade an account balance such as Amazon gift card balance over $250 in value? Are you attempting to trade a single gift card or multiple gift cards over $250 in value? Stop and see the appropriate rule and send in the form to modmail, otherwise your post will be removed and you'll receive an infraction.
* Rule 6: Do you have a prepaid card such as Visa? These cannot be traded for cash equivalents such as PayPal here! GCX is for trading gift cards - see /r/Cash4Cash if it is more appropriate.
* Rule 11: Are you selling a gift card? If you're a ``GCX Beginner`` you can only ask for PayPal Goods & Services! Asking for any other payment method (not including gift cards) will lead to a post removal.

Hi everyone,

Lost my Series 4 today to water damage. It had a cracked screen so it was only a matter of time. Looking for a replacement in either black or silver. Really prefer a Nike edition. Looking to spend under $200. 

Thanks!

If you have not read these, stop and do so now. Here's a condensed list that is absolutely essential to read before you move any further.

* Rule 1: DO NOT accept PMs without a public comment on GCX! Open your post and ensure you can see the comment. If you can't, don't engage with the user as they may be attempting to trick you by disguising a PM as a public comment. Was your post removed and someone immediately sent you a private message? Don't talk with them! Search the [**Universal Scammer List**](https://universalscammerlist.com/search.php). Did you receive a PM from modmail saying you can't sell the gift card on the sub, but you can sell it to the mod team? This is a scam! The mods of /r/giftcardexchange will never offer this ""service"" or ask you to reveal gift card information! Click on the sub name - it's likely a private sub named ""gitfcardexchange"" or ""giftcardexcharge"" attempting to impersonate the real /r/giftcardexchange.
* Rule 2: Investigate your trading partner! Is the account very inactive? Did they just become active and immediately start posting on trade subs? Are they trying to direct you off of Reddit to another site? These are red flags! Double check any links you're sent and ensure they aren't leading to a different domain outside of Reddit.
* Rules 4 and 5: Are you attempting to trade an account balance such as Amazon gift card balance over $250 in value? Are you attempting to trade a single gift card or multiple gift cards over $250 in value? Stop and see the appropriate rule and send in the form to modmail, otherwise your post will be removed and you'll receive an infraction.
* Rule 6: Do you have a prepaid card such as Visa? These cannot be traded for cash equivalents such as PayPal here! GCX is for trading gift cards - see /r/Cash4Cash if it is more appropriate.
* Rule 11: Are you selling a gift card? If you're a ``GCX Beginner`` you can only ask for PayPal Goods & Services! Asking for any other payment method (not including gift cards) will lead to a post removal.

905,0.2901442348957062,0.679381251335144,0.030474521219730377,"Hello, by trading here you agree that your post follows all of the [**GCX Rules**](https://www.reddit.com/r/giftcardexchange/wiki/rules). If you have not read these, stop and do so now. Here's a condensed list that is absolutely essential to read before you move any further.

* Rule 1: DO NOT accept PMs without a public comment on GCX! Open your post and ensure you can see the comment. If you can't, don't engage with the user as they may be attempting to trick you by disguising a PM as a public comment. Was your post removed and someone immediately sent you a private message? Don't talk with them! Search the [**Universal Scammer List**](https://universalscammerlist.com/search.php). Did you receive a PM from modmail saying you can't sell the gift card on the sub, but you can sell it to the mod team? This is a scam! The mods of /r/giftcardexchange will never offer this ""service"" or ask you to reveal gift card information! Click on the sub name - it's likely a private sub named ""gitfcardexchange"" or ""giftcardexcharge"" attempting to impersonate the real /r/giftcardexchange.
* Rule 2: Investigate your trading partner! Is the account very inactive? Did they just become active and immediately start posting on trade subs? Are they trying to direct you off of Reddit to another site? These are red flags! Double check any links you're sent and ensure they aren't leading to a different domain outside of Reddit.
* Rules 4 and 5: Are you attempting to trade an account balance such as Amazon gift card balance over $250 in value? Are you attempting to trade a single gift card or multiple gift cards over $250 in value? Stop and see the appropriate rule and send in the form to modmail, otherwise your post will be removed and you'll receive an infraction.
* Rule 6: Do you have a prepaid card such as Visa? These cannot be traded for cash equivalents such as PayPal here! GCX is for trading gift cards - see /r/Cash4Cash if it is more appropriate.
* Rule 11: Are you selling a gift card? If you're a ``GCX Beginner`` you can only ask for PayPal Goods & Services! Asking for any other payment method (not including gift cards) will lead to a post removal.

**Title:** [USA-NY] [H] Apple Watch SE 44 MM, Bose QC 35 2 [W] Local Cash, Paypal G&S

**Username:** /u/TonyStark826

**Body:**

Hi,

I have two things to sell:

1. Apple Watch SE 44 MM Nike edition Black - Bought last year. Is in very good condition, barely any scratches. Selling because I am moving out of the Apple ecosystem . I have only the M/L band and a Solo loop size 6 which will come along. No Box. Repairs: none **150$ local**
2. Bose QC 35 2 Black - Again very very good condition and no scratches on body. These have almost never left my office desk in an air-conditioned environment. Bought last year as well. Comes with original carrying case. Repairs: none **110$ local**

I prefer selling locally, and local zip code is 10025 (Basically Manhattan and Brooklyn/Queens/New Jersey). If I don't get local responses, might consider selling through Paypal G&S with extra for shipping.

If you have not read these, stop and do so now. Here's a condensed list that is absolutely essential to read before you move any further.

* Rule 1: DO NOT accept PMs without a public comment on GCX! Open your post and ensure you can see the comment. If you can't, don't engage with the user as they may be attempting to trick you by disguising a PM as a public comment. Was your post removed and someone immediately sent you a private message? Don't talk with them! Search the [**Universal Scammer List**](https://universalscammerlist.com/search.php). Did you receive a PM from modmail saying you can't sell the gift card on the sub, but you can sell it to the mod team? This is a scam! The mods of /r/giftcardexchange will never offer this ""service"" or ask you to reveal gift card information! Click on the sub name - it's likely a private sub named ""gitfcardexchange"" or ""giftcardexcharge"" attempting to impersonate the real /r/giftcardexchange.
* Rule 2: Investigate your trading partner! Is the account very inactive? Did they just become active and immediately start posting on trade subs? Are they trying to direct you off of Reddit to another site? These are red flags! Double check any links you're sent and ensure they aren't leading to a different domain outside of Reddit.
* Rules 4 and 5: Are you attempting to trade an account balance such as Amazon gift card balance over $250 in value? Are you attempting to trade a single gift card or multiple gift cards over $250 in value? Stop and see the appropriate rule and send in the form to modmail, otherwise your post will be removed and you'll receive an infraction.
* Rule 6: Do you have a prepaid card such as Visa? These cannot be traded for cash equivalents such as PayPal here! GCX is for trading gift cards - see /r/Cash4Cash if it is more appropriate.
* Rule 11: Are you selling a gift card? If you're a ``GCX Beginner`` you can only ask for PayPal Goods & Services! Asking for any other payment method (not including gift cards) will lead to a post removal.

A few reminders:

1. NO FAKES, ZERO TOLERANCE. If you are caught selling/trading fakes **OF ANY KIND** (sneakers or not), you will be permanently banned **without warning**.

**Title:** [USA-OK] [H] Apple Watch Series 7 Nike GPS with accessories [W] PayPal

**Username:** /u/Shoeless_Panda

**Body:**

Hi!

Selling a Apple Watch Series 7 Nike Edition.it’s used but comes with box and charger. It has a small scratch on the screen I tried to take a picture of it, hopefully you can see it.

Comes with the Nike Velcro band (White) it’s used so I’m adding the Bright Green Sport Band 45mm (retails $49)

Asking $250 for the watch. Plus exact shipping

I also have some accessories I am selling that in selling separately but can bundle them if needed:

Apple Watch Braided Loop Dark Cherry 45mm Size 5 (used it a few times) $40 shipped

Apple Watch Marigold Sport Band 45mm $35 shipped (just opened it, never used if) 

If price is too high, please let me know and I’ll adjust. Tried to find comps but it’s hard since it has a small scratch

Repairs: None

Thank you

# PLEASE READ: 
Hello, this is to let you know that your post is up and running.

Since you are selling, please make sure that you [read all rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/sneakermarket/about/rules/) to ensure that your post isn't removed by a moderator.

A few reminders:

1. NO FAKES, ZERO TOLERANCE. If you are caught selling/trading fakes **OF ANY KIND** (sneakers or not), you will be permanently banned **without warning**.

2. Please ensure that you have your items tagged **AND** priced. If not, your post will be removed **without warning**.

3. Only verified users can user their confirmation emails/photos. If you are not verified, please delete your post or a moderator will. To become verified, [create a reference here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SneakerMarketRefs/) and [send us a modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fsneakermarket) once you have 5 confirmed sales.


# AGAIN. ONLY VERIFIED FLAIRED USERS CAN USE EMAIL CONFIRMATION FOR RECENTLY RELEASED SHOES (so no tagged photos necessary).

5. No external links. Links to eBay, Grailed, and similar sites will be removed. Only link those as a reference and not a sale.

1. **All items must include a** ***handwritten*** **timestamp with your username and the current date included in at least one picture that shows all items listed for sale to show proof of ownership.** Additional pictures can be included in the album for increased detail. 
2. Payment method is limited to Paypal Goods and Services. Any other method (e.g. Venmo, Zelle, Cashapp, Paypal Friends and Family, et al) is prohibited **unless** you secure the services of a [Payment Proxy Member](https://www.reddit.com/r/GunAccessoriesForSale/wiki/proxy). Failure to adhere to this will result in the buyer being banned for 30 days and seller being banned for 90 days. Additionally, to make things as simple as possible, simply state whether or not the G&S fees are included in your listed price(s). 

If your post is not in compliance with these rules, you may be banned.  Do not make a new posting, **edit this posting** to ensure it complies, or you may be banned.

Be careful when asked to use payment methods such as zelle, venmo, or Paypal F&F because those payment methods put you at higher risk of them disappearing with your money, or use a [Proxy Member](https://www.reddit.com/r/GunAccessoriesForSale/wiki/proxy).

Hello, this is to let you know that your post is up and running.

Since you are selling, please make sure that you [read all rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/sneakermarket/about/rules/) to ensure that your post isn't removed by a moderator.

A few reminders:

1. NO FAKES, ZERO TOLERANCE. If you are caught selling/trading fakes **OF ANY KIND** (sneakers or not), you will be permanently banned **without warning**.

2. Please ensure that you have your items tagged **AND** priced. If not, your post will be removed **without warning**.

3. Only verified users can user their confirmation emails/photos. If you are not verified, please delete your post or a moderator will. To become verified, [create a reference here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SneakerMarketRefs/) and [send us a modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fsneakermarket) once you have 5 confirmed sales.


# AGAIN. ONLY VERIFIED FLAIRED USERS CAN USE EMAIL CONFIRMATION FOR RECENTLY RELEASED SHOES (so no tagged photos necessary).

5. No external links. Links to eBay, Grailed, and similar sites will be removed. Only link those as a reference and not a sale.

If you have not read these, stop and do so now. Here's a condensed list that is absolutely essential to read before you move any further.

* Rule 1: DO NOT accept PMs without a public comment on GCX! Open your post and ensure you can see the comment. If you can't, don't engage with the user as they may be attempting to trick you by disguising a PM as a public comment. Was your post removed and someone immediately sent you a private message? Don't talk with them! Search the [**Universal Scammer List**](https://universalscammerlist.com/search.php). Did you receive a PM from modmail saying you can't sell the gift card on the sub, but you can sell it to the mod team? This is a scam! The mods of /r/giftcardexchange will never offer this ""service"" or ask you to reveal gift card information! Click on the sub name - it's likely a private sub named ""gitfcardexchange"" or ""giftcardexcharge"" attempting to impersonate the real /r/giftcardexchange.
* Rule 2: Investigate your trading partner! Is the account very inactive? Did they just become active and immediately start posting on trade subs? Are they trying to direct you off of Reddit to another site? These are red flags! Double check any links you're sent and ensure they aren't leading to a different domain outside of Reddit.
* Rules 4 and 5: Are you attempting to trade an account balance such as Amazon gift card balance over $250 in value? Are you attempting to trade a single gift card or multiple gift cards over $250 in value? Stop and see the appropriate rule and send in the form to modmail, otherwise your post will be removed and you'll receive an infraction.
* Rule 6: Do you have a prepaid card such as Visa? These cannot be traded for cash equivalents such as PayPal here! GCX is for trading gift cards - see /r/Cash4Cash if it is more appropriate.
* Rule 11: Are you selling a gift card? If you're a ``GCX Beginner`` you can only ask for PayPal Goods & Services! Asking for any other payment method (not including gift cards) will lead to a post removal.

**Title:** [USA-MA] [H] iPhone 12 Pro 128 GB, Apple Watch Nike Series 5 GPS/Cellular [W] Paypal, Local Cash

**Username:** /u/tommygatz

**Body:**

Selling 2 items:

iPhone 12 Pro 128 GB. [Timestamps](https://imgur.com/a/4CuqVOt).

* Screen and back are in perfect condition.
* Only damage is a small knick in the corner on the metal part (shown in pics).
* Battery health 86%.
* Used regularly for about a year, always in a case and with screen protector. I took the cracked screen protector off for pics, but will install a new one for you before shipping if you want!
* Ships in original box with original charger. 
* Repairs: NONE.
* Asking $700 shipped via Paypal invoice, $650 Local cash.

Apple Watch Nike Series 5, GPS/Cellular version. [Timestamps](https://imgur.com/a/YvNITnF).

* Zero damage on any part of the watch. Always used with a screen protector (still installed, see pics) and a case around the sides.
* Ships in original box with original band and charger. 
* Repairs: NONE.
* Asking $200 shipped via Paypal invoice, $175 Local cash.

I'll happily bundle the two together for $850 shipped, or $800 Local cash.

Local is 02721 area preferred, but Boston area works during the work week.

A few reminders:

1. NO FAKES, ZERO TOLERANCE. If you are caught selling/trading fakes **OF ANY KIND** (sneakers or not), you will be permanently banned **without warning**.

2. Please ensure that you have your items tagged **AND** priced. If not, your post will be removed **without warning**.

**Title:** [USA-IA][H] Apple Watch Series 7 45mm Stainless Steel [W] PayPal

**Username:** /u/paxsnacks

**Body:**

Timestamps: https://imgur.com/a/LYk7KUB

**Apple Watch Series 7 Stainless Steel**

Specs:
-	Graphite Color
-	Included band: Anthracite/Black Nike Sport Band (8.5/10 condition - no markings or blemishes but in the right light the typical band wear can be seen)
-	Stainless Steel (so GPS + cellular)
-	Monthly AppleCare+ - I will keep the AC + for the remainder of the month. This watch should be new enough for you to be able to add it if you’d like. 
-	Battery health: 100%
-	Repairs: none

Included accessories:
-	USB-A magnetic charger (not pictured)
-	S/M & M/L Sport Band sizes
-	Aftermarket watch cover (not pictured)
-	DOES NOT include original packaging

I just purchased this watch on this subreddit about a month ago. Its condition is essentially brand new with absolutely no wear, scratches or blemishes. The 45mm is just a bit bigger than I prefer so I'm downsizing in general. I've been meaning to get a smaller watch for years but my band collection has held me back. No longer!

**I’m looking to net $440 for this watch so I’m asking for $465 total! **

I ship with insurance (typically with USPS) because I prefer the peace of mind!

If you have not read these, stop and do so now. Here's a condensed list that is absolutely essential to read before you move any further.

* Rule 1: DO NOT accept PMs without a public comment on GCX! Open your post and ensure you can see the comment. If you can't, don't engage with the user as they may be attempting to trick you by disguising a PM as a public comment. Was your post removed and someone immediately sent you a private message? Don't talk with them! Search the [**Universal Scammer List**](https://universalscammerlist.com/search.php). Did you receive a PM from modmail saying you can't sell the gift card on the sub, but you can sell it to the mod team? This is a scam! The mods of /r/giftcardexchange will never offer this ""service"" or ask you to reveal gift card information! Click on the sub name - it's likely a private sub named ""gitfcardexchange"" or ""giftcardexcharge"" attempting to impersonate the real /r/giftcardexchange.
* Rule 2: Investigate your trading partner! Is the account very inactive? Did they just become active and immediately start posting on trade subs? Are they trying to direct you off of Reddit to another site? These are red flags! Double check any links you're sent and ensure they aren't leading to a different domain outside of Reddit.
* Rules 4 and 5: Are you attempting to trade an account balance such as Amazon gift card balance over $250 in value? Are you attempting to trade a single gift card or multiple gift cards over $250 in value? Stop and see the appropriate rule and send in the form to modmail, otherwise your post will be removed and you'll receive an infraction.
* Rule 6: Do you have a prepaid card such as Visa? These cannot be traded for cash equivalents such as PayPal here! GCX is for trading gift cards - see /r/Cash4Cash if it is more appropriate.
* Rule 11: Are you selling a gift card? If you're a ``GCX Beginner`` you can only ask for PayPal Goods & Services! Asking for any other payment method (not including gift cards) will lead to a post removal.

1583,0.2901442348957062,0.679381251335144,0.030474521219730377,"Hello, by trading here you agree that your post follows all of the [**GCX Rules**](https://www.reddit.com/r/giftcardexchange/wiki/rules). If you have not read these, stop and do so now. Here's a condensed list that is absolutely essential to read before you move any further.

* Rule 1: DO NOT accept PMs without a public comment on GCX! Open your post and ensure you can see the comment. If you can't, don't engage with the user as they may be attempting to trick you by disguising a PM as a public comment. Was your post removed and someone immediately sent you a private message? Don't talk with them! Search the [**Universal Scammer List**](https://universalscammerlist.com/search.php). Did you receive a PM from modmail saying you can't sell the gift card on the sub, but you can sell it to the mod team? This is a scam! The mods of /r/giftcardexchange will never offer this ""service"" or ask you to reveal gift card information! Click on the sub name - it's likely a private sub named ""gitfcardexchange"" or ""giftcardexcharge"" attempting to impersonate the real /r/giftcardexchange.
* Rule 2: Investigate your trading partner! Is the account very inactive? Did they just become active and immediately start posting on trade subs? Are they trying to direct you off of Reddit to another site? These are red flags! Double check any links you're sent and ensure they aren't leading to a different domain outside of Reddit.
* Rules 4 and 5: Are you attempting to trade an account balance such as Amazon gift card balance over $250 in value? Are you attempting to trade a single gift card or multiple gift cards over $250 in value? Stop and see the appropriate rule and send in the form to modmail, otherwise your post will be removed and you'll receive an infraction.
* Rule 6: Do you have a prepaid card such as Visa? These cannot be traded for cash equivalents such as PayPal here! GCX is for trading gift cards - see /r/Cash4Cash if it is more appropriate.
* Rule 11: Are you selling a gift card? If you're a ``GCX Beginner`` you can only ask for PayPal Goods & Services! Asking for any other payment method (not including gift cards) will lead to a post removal.

If you have not read these, stop and do so now. Here's a condensed list that is absolutely essential to read before you move any further.

* Rule 1: DO NOT accept PMs without a public comment on GCX! Open your post and ensure you can see the comment. If you can't, don't engage with the user as they may be attempting to trick you by disguising a PM as a public comment. Was your post removed and someone immediately sent you a private message? Don't talk with them! Search the [**Universal Scammer List**](https://universalscammerlist.com/search.php). Did you receive a PM from modmail saying you can't sell the gift card on the sub, but you can sell it to the mod team? This is a scam! The mods of /r/giftcardexchange will never offer this ""service"" or ask you to reveal gift card information! Click on the sub name - it's likely a private sub named ""gitfcardexchange"" or ""giftcardexcharge"" attempting to impersonate the real /r/giftcardexchange.
* Rule 2: Investigate your trading partner! Is the account very inactive? Did they just become active and immediately start posting on trade subs? Are they trying to direct you off of Reddit to another site? These are red flags! Double check any links you're sent and ensure they aren't leading to a different domain outside of Reddit.
* Rules 4 and 5: Are you attempting to trade an account balance such as Amazon gift card balance over $250 in value? Are you attempting to trade a single gift card or multiple gift cards over $250 in value? Stop and see the appropriate rule and send in the form to modmail, otherwise your post will be removed and you'll receive an infraction.
* Rule 6: Do you have a prepaid card such as Visa? These cannot be traded for cash equivalents such as PayPal here! GCX is for trading gift cards - see /r/Cash4Cash if it is more appropriate.
* Rule 11: Are you selling a gift card? If you're a ``GCX Beginner`` you can only ask for PayPal Goods & Services! Asking for any other payment method (not including gift cards) will lead to a post removal.

Hello, this is to let you know that your post is up and running.

Since you are selling, please make sure that you [read all rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/sneakermarket/about/rules/) to ensure that your post isn't removed by a moderator.

A few reminders:

1. NO FAKES, ZERO TOLERANCE. If you are caught selling/trading fakes **OF ANY KIND** (sneakers or not), you will be permanently banned **without warning**.

2. Please ensure that you have your items tagged **AND** priced. If not, your post will be removed **without warning**.

3. Only verified users can user their confirmation emails/photos. If you are not verified, please delete your post or a moderator will. To become verified, [create a reference here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SneakerMarketRefs/) and [send us a modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fsneakermarket) once you have 5 confirmed sales.


# AGAIN. ONLY VERIFIED FLAIRED USERS CAN USE EMAIL CONFIRMATION FOR RECENTLY RELEASED SHOES (so no tagged photos necessary).

5. No external links. Links to eBay, Grailed, and similar sites will be removed. Only link those as a reference and not a sale.

**Title:** [USA-IA][H] 11” 2020 iPad Pro w/Magic Keyboard & Pencil, Apple Watch Series 7 [W] PayPal

**Username:** /u/paxsnacks

**Body:**

Timestamps: https://imgur.com/a/CG4XDlC


**iPad Pro**

Specs:
-	Space Grey
-	128gb Storage
-	Wifi Model
-	Out of warranty
-	Battery Condition: 203 Cycles, 91% Battery health

Included Accessories:
-	Magic Keyboard (6/10 condition, used with Dbrand skin - photos in album)
-	Apple Pencil 2 (10/10 condition, perfect!)
-	Does not include charger
-	Includes original boxes for iPad and Magic Keyboard, none for pencil!

This iPad is decent condition. It was used for college and as such has some blemishes. I’ve listed them in the photo album. The good news is that none are major. The iPad is still perfectly flat and the screen has been used with a cover up until very recently. I’d say the iPad is 6/10 condition. I’ll check on the battery cycles later and update this post with them but I will say it has been strong for my use. 

I’m looking to net $550, so I’m asking $585 firm for this iPad. That price allows me to ship it with insurance so there are no issues.



**Apple Watch Series 7**

Specs:
-	Graphite Color
-	Included band: Anthracite/Black Nike Sport Band (8.5/10 condition - no markings or blemishes but in the right light the typical band wear can be seen)
-	Stainless Steel (so GPS + cellular)
-	Monthly AppleCare+ - I will keep the AC + for the remainder of the month. This watch should be new enough for you to be able to add it if you’d like. 
-	Battery health: 100%
-	Repairs: none

Included accessories:
-	USB-A magnetic charger (not pictured)
-	S/M & M/L Sport Band sizes
-	Aftermarket watch cover (not pictured)
-	DOES NOT include original packaging

I just purchased this watch on this subreddit about a week ago. Its condition is essentially brand new with absolutely no wear, scratches or blemishes. The 45mm is just a bit bigger than I prefer so I'm downsizing in general. I've been meaning to get a smaller watch for years but my band collection has held me back. No longer!

I’m looking to net $440 for this watch so I’m asking for $465 total!

If you have not read these, stop and do so now. Here's a condensed list that is absolutely essential to read before you move any further.

* Rule 1: DO NOT accept PMs without a public comment on GCX! Open your post and ensure you can see the comment. If you can't, don't engage with the user as they may be attempting to trick you by disguising a PM as a public comment. Was your post removed and someone immediately sent you a private message? Don't talk with them! Search the [**Universal Scammer List**](https://universalscammerlist.com/search.php). Did you receive a PM from modmail saying you can't sell the gift card on the sub, but you can sell it to the mod team? This is a scam! The mods of /r/giftcardexchange will never offer this ""service"" or ask you to reveal gift card information! Click on the sub name - it's likely a private sub named ""gitfcardexchange"" or ""giftcardexcharge"" attempting to impersonate the real /r/giftcardexchange.
* Rule 2: Investigate your trading partner! Is the account very inactive? Did they just become active and immediately start posting on trade subs? Are they trying to direct you off of Reddit to another site? These are red flags! Double check any links you're sent and ensure they aren't leading to a different domain outside of Reddit.
* Rules 4 and 5: Are you attempting to trade an account balance such as Amazon gift card balance over $250 in value? Are you attempting to trade a single gift card or multiple gift cards over $250 in value? Stop and see the appropriate rule and send in the form to modmail, otherwise your post will be removed and you'll receive an infraction.
* Rule 6: Do you have a prepaid card such as Visa? These cannot be traded for cash equivalents such as PayPal here! GCX is for trading gift cards - see /r/Cash4Cash if it is more appropriate.
* Rule 11: Are you selling a gift card? If you're a ``GCX Beginner`` you can only ask for PayPal Goods & Services! Asking for any other payment method (not including gift cards) will lead to a post removal.

If you have not read these, stop and do so now. Here's a condensed list that is absolutely essential to read before you move any further.

* Rule 1: DO NOT accept PMs without a public comment on GCX! Open your post and ensure you can see the comment. If you can't, don't engage with the user as they may be attempting to trick you by disguising a PM as a public comment. Was your post removed and someone immediately sent you a private message? Don't talk with them! Search the [**Universal Scammer List**](https://universalscammerlist.com/search.php). Did you receive a PM from modmail saying you can't sell the gift card on the sub, but you can sell it to the mod team? This is a scam! The mods of /r/giftcardexchange will never offer this ""service"" or ask you to reveal gift card information! Click on the sub name - it's likely a private sub named ""gitfcardexchange"" or ""giftcardexcharge"" attempting to impersonate the real /r/giftcardexchange.
* Rule 2: Investigate your trading partner! Is the account very inactive? Did they just become active and immediately start posting on trade subs? Are they trying to direct you off of Reddit to another site? These are red flags! Double check any links you're sent and ensure they aren't leading to a different domain outside of Reddit.
* Rules 4 and 5: Are you attempting to trade an account balance such as Amazon gift card balance over $250 in value? Are you attempting to trade a single gift card or multiple gift cards over $250 in value? Stop and see the appropriate rule and send in the form to modmail, otherwise your post will be removed and you'll receive an infraction.
* Rule 6: Do you have a prepaid card such as Visa? These cannot be traded for cash equivalents such as PayPal here! GCX is for trading gift cards - see /r/Cash4Cash if it is more appropriate.
* Rule 11: Are you selling a gift card? If you're a ``GCX Beginner`` you can only ask for PayPal Goods & Services! Asking for any other payment method (not including gift cards) will lead to a post removal.

If you have not read these, stop and do so now. Here's a condensed list that is absolutely essential to read before you move any further.

* Rule 1: DO NOT accept PMs without a public comment on GCX! Open your post and ensure you can see the comment. If you can't, don't engage with the user as they may be attempting to trick you by disguising a PM as a public comment. Was your post removed and someone immediately sent you a private message? Don't talk with them! Search the [**Universal Scammer List**](https://universalscammerlist.com/search.php). Did you receive a PM from modmail saying you can't sell the gift card on the sub, but you can sell it to the mod team? This is a scam! The mods of /r/giftcardexchange will never offer this ""service"" or ask you to reveal gift card information! Click on the sub name - it's likely a private sub named ""gitfcardexchange"" or ""giftcardexcharge"" attempting to impersonate the real /r/giftcardexchange.
* Rule 2: Investigate your trading partner! Is the account very inactive? Did they just become active and immediately start posting on trade subs? Are they trying to direct you off of Reddit to another site? These are red flags! Double check any links you're sent and ensure they aren't leading to a different domain outside of Reddit.
* Rules 4 and 5: Are you attempting to trade an account balance such as Amazon gift card balance over $250 in value? Are you attempting to trade a single gift card or multiple gift cards over $250 in value? Stop and see the appropriate rule and send in the form to modmail, otherwise your post will be removed and you'll receive an infraction.
* Rule 6: Do you have a prepaid card such as Visa? These cannot be traded for cash equivalents such as PayPal here! GCX is for trading gift cards - see /r/Cash4Cash if it is more appropriate.
* Rule 11: Are you selling a gift card? If you're a ``GCX Beginner`` you can only ask for PayPal Goods & Services! Asking for any other payment method (not including gift cards) will lead to a post removal.

* Rules 4 and 5: Are you attempting to trade an account balance such as Amazon gift card balance over $250 in value? Are you attempting to trade a single gift card or multiple gift cards over $250 in value? Stop and see the appropriate rule and send in the form to modmail, otherwise your post will be removed and you'll receive an infraction.
* Rule 6: Do you have a prepaid card such as Visa? These cannot be traded for cash equivalents such as PayPal here! GCX is for trading gift cards - see /r/Cash4Cash if it is more appropriate.
* Rule 11: Are you selling a gift card? If you're a ``GCX Beginner`` you can only ask for PayPal Goods & Services! Asking for any other payment method (not including gift cards) will lead to a post removal.

You could literally dress your kid up as a tube of generic toothpaste and someone out there? Is going to take issue with it. 

Because that’s our world today. 

It’s Halloween. Let your kids pick their own costumes. It’s supposed to be fun and candy. Not some adult and parental political statement.

Edit: it’s as easy as not dressing your kids up in black face or native gear against their wishes and your better judgement."

If you have not read these, stop and do so now. Here's a condensed list that is absolutely essential to read before you move any further.

* Rule 1: DO NOT accept PMs without a public comment on GCX! Open your post and ensure you can see the comment. If you can't, don't engage with the user as they may be attempting to trick you by disguising a PM as a public comment. Was your post removed and someone immediately sent you a private message? Don't talk with them! Search the [**Universal Scammer List**](https://universalscammerlist.com/search.php). Did you receive a PM from modmail saying you can't sell the gift card on the sub, but you can sell it to the mod team? This is a scam! The mods of /r/giftcardexchange will never offer this ""service"" or ask you to reveal gift card information! Click on the sub name - it's likely a private sub named ""gitfcardexchange"" or ""giftcardexcharge"" attempting to impersonate the real /r/giftcardexchange.
* Rule 2: Investigate your trading partner! Is the account very inactive? Did they just become active and immediately start posting on trade subs? Are they trying to direct you off of Reddit to another site? These are red flags! Double check any links you're sent and ensure they aren't leading to a different domain outside of Reddit.
* Rules 4 and 5: Are you attempting to trade an account balance such as Amazon gift card balance over $250 in value? Are you attempting to trade a single gift card or multiple gift cards over $250 in value? Stop and see the appropriate rule and send in the form to modmail, otherwise your post will be removed and you'll receive an infraction.
* Rule 6: Do you have a prepaid card such as Visa? These cannot be traded for cash equivalents such as PayPal here! GCX is for trading gift cards - see /r/Cash4Cash if it is more appropriate.
* Rule 11: Are you selling a gift card? If you're a ``GCX Beginner`` you can only ask for PayPal Goods & Services! Asking for any other payment method (not including gift cards) will lead to a post removal.

A few reminders:

1. NO FAKES, ZERO TOLERANCE. If you are caught selling/trading fakes **OF ANY KIND** (sneakers or not), you will be permanently banned **without warning**.

If you have not read these, stop and do so now. Here's a condensed list that is absolutely essential to read before you move any further.

* Rule 1: DO NOT accept PMs without a public comment on GCX! Open your post and ensure you can see the comment. If you can't, don't engage with the user as they may be attempting to trick you by disguising a PM as a public comment. Was your post removed and someone immediately sent you a private message? Don't talk with them! Search the [**Universal Scammer List**](https://universalscammerlist.com/search.php). Did you receive a PM from modmail saying you can't sell the gift card on the sub, but you can sell it to the mod team? This is a scam! The mods of /r/giftcardexchange will never offer this ""service"" or ask you to reveal gift card information! Click on the sub name - it's likely a private sub named ""gitfcardexchange"" or ""giftcardexcharge"" attempting to impersonate the real /r/giftcardexchange.
* Rule 2: Investigate your trading partner! Is the account very inactive? Did they just become active and immediately start posting on trade subs? Are they trying to direct you off of Reddit to another site? These are red flags! Double check any links you're sent and ensure they aren't leading to a different domain outside of Reddit.
* Rules 4 and 5: Are you attempting to trade an account balance such as Amazon gift card balance over $250 in value? Are you attempting to trade a single gift card or multiple gift cards over $250 in value? Stop and see the appropriate rule and send in the form to modmail, otherwise your post will be removed and you'll receive an infraction.
* Rule 6: Do you have a prepaid card such as Visa? These cannot be traded for cash equivalents such as PayPal here! GCX is for trading gift cards - see /r/Cash4Cash if it is more appropriate.
* Rule 11: Are you selling a gift card? If you're a ``GCX Beginner`` you can only ask for PayPal Goods & Services! Asking for any other payment method (not including gift cards) will lead to a post removal.

If you have not read these, stop and do so now. Here's a condensed list that is absolutely essential to read before you move any further.

* Rule 1: DO NOT accept PMs without a public comment on GCX! Open your post and ensure you can see the comment. If you can't, don't engage with the user as they may be attempting to trick you by disguising a PM as a public comment. Was your post removed and someone immediately sent you a private message? Don't talk with them! Search the [**Universal Scammer List**](https://universalscammerlist.com/search.php). Did you receive a PM from modmail saying you can't sell the gift card on the sub, but you can sell it to the mod team? This is a scam! The mods of /r/giftcardexchange will never offer this ""service"" or ask you to reveal gift card information! Click on the sub name - it's likely a private sub named ""gitfcardexchange"" or ""giftcardexcharge"" attempting to impersonate the real /r/giftcardexchange.
* Rule 2: Investigate your trading partner! Is the account very inactive? Did they just become active and immediately start posting on trade subs? Are they trying to direct you off of Reddit to another site? These are red flags! Double check any links you're sent and ensure they aren't leading to a different domain outside of Reddit.
* Rules 4 and 5: Are you attempting to trade an account balance such as Amazon gift card balance over $250 in value? Are you attempting to trade a single gift card or multiple gift cards over $250 in value? Stop and see the appropriate rule and send in the form to modmail, otherwise your post will be removed and you'll receive an infraction.
* Rule 6: Do you have a prepaid card such as Visa? These cannot be traded for cash equivalents such as PayPal here! GCX is for trading gift cards - see /r/Cash4Cash if it is more appropriate.
* Rule 11: Are you selling a gift card? If you're a ``GCX Beginner`` you can only ask for PayPal Goods & Services! Asking for any other payment method (not including gift cards) will lead to a post removal.

If you have not read these, stop and do so now. Here's a condensed list that is absolutely essential to read before you move any further.

* Rule 1: DO NOT accept PMs without a public comment on GCX! Open your post and ensure you can see the comment. If you can't, don't engage with the user as they may be attempting to trick you by disguising a PM as a public comment. Was your post removed and someone immediately sent you a private message? Don't talk with them! Search the [**Universal Scammer List**](https://universalscammerlist.com/search.php). Did you receive a PM from modmail saying you can't sell the gift card on the sub, but you can sell it to the mod team? This is a scam! The mods of /r/giftcardexchange will never offer this ""service"" or ask you to reveal gift card information! Click on the sub name - it's likely a private sub named ""gitfcardexchange"" or ""giftcardexcharge"" attempting to impersonate the real /r/giftcardexchange.
* Rule 2: Investigate your trading partner! Is the account very inactive? Did they just become active and immediately start posting on trade subs? Are they trying to direct you off of Reddit to another site? These are red flags! Double check any links you're sent and ensure they aren't leading to a different domain outside of Reddit.
* Rules 4 and 5: Are you attempting to trade an account balance such as Amazon gift card balance over $250 in value? Are you attempting to trade a single gift card or multiple gift cards over $250 in value? Stop and see the appropriate rule and send in the form to modmail, otherwise your post will be removed and you'll receive an infraction.
* Rule 6: Do you have a prepaid card such as Visa? These cannot be traded for cash equivalents such as PayPal here! GCX is for trading gift cards - see /r/Cash4Cash if it is more appropriate.
* Rule 11: Are you selling a gift card? If you're a ``GCX Beginner`` you can only ask for PayPal Goods & Services! Asking for any other payment method (not including gift cards) will lead to a post removal.

If you have not read these, stop and do so now. Here's a condensed list that is absolutely essential to read before you move any further.

* Rule 1: DO NOT accept PMs without a public comment on GCX! Open your post and ensure you can see the comment. If you can't, don't engage with the user as they may be attempting to trick you by disguising a PM as a public comment. Was your post removed and someone immediately sent you a private message? Don't talk with them! Search the [**Universal Scammer List**](https://universalscammerlist.com/search.php). Did you receive a PM from modmail saying you can't sell the gift card on the sub, but you can sell it to the mod team? This is a scam! The mods of /r/giftcardexchange will never offer this ""service"" or ask you to reveal gift card information! Click on the sub name - it's likely a private sub named ""gitfcardexchange"" or ""giftcardexcharge"" attempting to impersonate the real /r/giftcardexchange.
* Rule 2: Investigate your trading partner! Is the account very inactive? Did they just become active and immediately start posting on trade subs? Are they trying to direct you off of Reddit to another site? These are red flags! Double check any links you're sent and ensure they aren't leading to a different domain outside of Reddit.
* Rules 4 and 5: Are you attempting to trade an account balance such as Amazon gift card balance over $250 in value? Are you attempting to trade a single gift card or multiple gift cards over $250 in value? Stop and see the appropriate rule and send in the form to modmail, otherwise your post will be removed and you'll receive an infraction.
* Rule 6: Do you have a prepaid card such as Visa? These cannot be traded for cash equivalents such as PayPal here! GCX is for trading gift cards - see /r/Cash4Cash if it is more appropriate.
* Rule 11: Are you selling a gift card? If you're a ``GCX Beginner`` you can only ask for PayPal Goods & Services! Asking for any other payment method (not including gift cards) will lead to a post removal.

It’s interesting how hardcore Trumpers get SOOOO angry over the slightest amount of friction. They claim they’re “anti cancel culture” yet they’re the verbally combative ones and creating their own social media echo chambers (Parker, Truth Social). 

I’m sorry about your friend, it sounds like he’s a typical example of someone that was always a little vulnerable to extremism. People who experienced any sort of loss or unfortunate financial circumstances are more likely to succumb to extremism as a defense mechanism. It’s always easier to blame someone than to say “today was not my time” or “I was accountable” for xyz."

The Q people say they are ""open-minded"" and ""just asking questions"", but the truth is they go into screaming rants any time someone even slightly rebuts any of their completely batshit crazy beliefs.  Like the only way they can hold onto them is to have blind faith in the beliefs and surround themselves with others who think the same.  Because those beliefs are so shaky to begin with (since they obviously lack any kind of proof) they feel they must defend them religiously and anyone who questions them they take as a personal attack and, thus, they feel the need to unleash insults.  Probably because that's all they have to argue with since they have no facts.

It reminds me of an old Monty Python sketch.  A famous hypnotist, El Mystico, erected a block of buildings built purely on hypnosis.  And as long as the people who lived in them BELIEVED they existed, they did.  But as soon as someone started to question the logic and rationality of the whole thing the buildings started to fall.  So the only way they could stay up was everyone had to blindly believe they were there."

If I was married to someone like that I would feel like I didn't know who they are. I couldn't do it. Eventually I'd have to ask myself does this person care about the same things I do. I know a lot of conservative men are angry about not being able to find a female to date because of their politics. Being with someone non-political is no issue.

Vaccinations have been the last thing I worry about....it's everything else flat earth, tunnels under the world, Nato putting her in a concentration camp, the world ending in 2 years, Diana & Prince are still alive (I would love it if Prince part was true!) & the list goes on! Being in Australia most people have never heard of Q so she switches all the time. On a good note, she has been off these sites now for nearly 6 weeks when she decided Trump was really one of the 'Bad People'! Obama is still really Lucifer.

This is it.

Her conspiracy belief comes from an emotional need that the beliefs fulfill, usually to feel special or smart or safe. Being accepted by her dad as a normal person is part of what fulfills that emotional need, so when he visits, she ""believes"" what she needs to in order to get that fulfillment. All the beliefs - both the paranoid conspiracism and the normal ones - are equally sincere whenever she believes them, because the thing she really ultimately believes is her insecurity. 

On the other hand, spreading her conspiracy beliefs to you seems to fulfill whatever her emotional need is, or perhaps a different need."

So I ended up returning and purchasing this pair instead from Passerby: https://shop1814230492.v.weidian.com/item.html?itemID=4390704582

It was 140 yuan with shipping, and honestly, for 34 (TJ was 99 + 7 yuan shipping) yuan more, I don’t have to deal with glue stains or any other issues. I don’t have them in hand, but the QC pics look a lot better. Looks identical to the images posted by the shop.

Even post recovery. They obviously projected those issues onto you because of the whole Adderall stigma (been taking it for about 8 years myself and have never had the desire to abuse it or anything else). It’s one thing to express concern about possible future abuse (my husband had his own concerns), but to verbally and emotionally attack you is never ever okay.  I agree with those saying to cut ties with them, that’s not how friends behave and you don’t need that nonsense in your life. If it were me, I would be polite if I saw them in person, but that would be the extent of it. If you think there’s a chance either friend may have told anyone else about your diagnosis and treatment, I would call them and tell them to stop telling others about your personal medical information and keep the conversation focused on that only."

Some people have baggage about medication that is coloured by their own experiences and they can't help projecting their experiences on to you. They do it because they care, but they don't have the capacity to understand that everyone's experiences and reactions are different. 

There might also be a touch of unconscious ""trying to keep you at their level"" in there too. If you get medication that helps you, you might have the energy to try new things and meet new people and you might ""abandon"" them (this is probably the story unfolding now actually, except it will be ""she chose drugs over us""). However, it makes no sense to stop taking a medication that is helping you and isn't having a detrimental impact on your life just because of someone else's issues. 

It's not going to help you to intentionally be around them; it sounds like it causes distress for everyone. It's unlikely to be helpful to have a confrontation either. It might just be time to ""grow apart"" and just see these people at events you are both invited to, but don't actively maintain the friendship."

It has not been the subject of any credible peer-reviewed scientific research. It is not listed in either of the top two psychiatric diagnostic manuals, the DSM or ICD. It has been propagated solely through blogs and the internet by William Dodson, who coined the term in the context of ADHD. This means that Dodson, his explanation of these experiences, and claims about how to treat it all warrant healthy skepticism.

Here are some scientific articles on ADHD and rejection:

* [Rejection sensitivity and disruption of attention by social threat cues](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2771869/)
* [Justice and rejection sensitivity in children and adolescents with ADHD symptoms](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24878677/)
* [Rejection sensitivity and social outcomes of young adult men with ADHD](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17242422/)

Although r/ADHD's rules strictly disallow discussion of other 'popular science' (aka unproven theories), we find that many, many people identify with the concept of RSD, and this post has therefore **not** been removed.  We do not want to minimise or downplay your feelings, and we find that many people use RSD as a shorthand for this shared experience of struggling with emotions. 

However, please consider using the terms 'rejection sensitivity' and 'emotional dysregulation' instead.

Your post hasn't been removed, and this is not a punitive action. This comment is meant solely to be informative.

I am guessing it's because of an expectation that martials are supposed to scale through increasing number of attacks, but that's just not how it works in PF2. Martial damage scales through a combination of runes, ability score increases, weapon specialization and class feats.

This is related to your question about two weapon fighting, I think. It just doesn't work the way it does in D&D. Wielding two weapons provides other advantages than increasing number of attacks at the expense of to hit penalties.  The action economy is very simple."
2226,0.02824048511683941,0.657747209072113,0.3140123784542084,"the mechanical balance is hard to grasp from the book itself. if you're comparing pf2e classes both to each other and to their dnd5e counterparts. with statements like ""martials don't seem to scale well"" i can't help but wondering if you're comparing them to pf2e casters, each other or dnd5e classes. 

for rogues in particular they're much more encouraged to be played as a melee class than in dnd5e. they can also get their sneak attack damage also from flanking or tripping enemies rather than only relying on stealth. 

in regards to multi-attacking, the general way that martials work is that with average rolls around an enemy of your level your first attack should hit, your second attack may hit and your third attack will only hit on a natural 20 or other extreme cases of luck. this is to encourage players to use one action to set up flanking, trip enemies or debuff them in some other way.

ranged damage is not as good, as the numbers are lower and dex to damage doesn't exist, as a tradeoff of being out of enemies reach. casters, while good at aoe damage usually can't outdo martials on single target damage. and their spell saves dc scale slower than martials and with multiple targets there's a much higher likelihood of someone rolling really well and negating the effect completely, which does lower the value of a spent spell slot tremendously. they definitely much weaker at raw damage than their 5e counterparts, as you're encouraged to focus on utility instead. 

I can answer more questions to help you see the balance, but I think it might be easier for you to get a feel for the system by running a mock battle and see how combat flows in practice. I've also played dnd5e in the past and I strongly prefer how the pieces fit together here."
2227,0.04675474762916565,0.7492155432701111,0.20402966439723969,"If 5e is all you have known, I can see how you could get confused. PF2 is a different system. Sure it uses a d20 system but it has a great bit of differences.

1) Your ""to hit"" bonus is based on Ability Modifiers, Proficiency, and any bonuses/penalties.  Your Proficiency increases with level. Multiple Attack Penalty (MAP) usually stays the same, but there are some ways to mitigate it. Agile weapons and the Ranger's Flurry are a couple of examples. Some martial classes have Feats that allow them to make two strikes without incurring MAP (example Double Slice).

2) Two Weapon Fighting has a few benefits. As mentioned above, Double Slice requires you to be wielding two weapons. You'll find other Feats that might benefit a dual wielding build. Additionally, a non-agile weapon tends to deal more base damage but an agile weapon is more accurate on the second strike as it reduces MAP. So one tactic is to hold a damage dealing main weapon and an agile secondary weapon.

3) many spells are weaker than similar 5e spells. This actually puts casters and martials on pretty even ground.

Additional notes: Dual Wielding is a viable option, but it's not any more or any less powerful than wielding a single weapon. You'll want to take Feats to build your character into the badass you want to be."

The point of two-weapon fighting without feats is having weapons with different traits or damage types. You could attack with a higher damage weapon like a longsword or rapier first, then switch to an agile weapon in the other hand for the second attack, to reduce your multiple attack penalty.

Also note that having a free hand is a perfectly viable strategy in PF2 as it allows you to interact with items and do combat maneuvers.

Martials scale with magical weapons which are a core part of the system, i.e. the game assumes you have level appropriate magical equipment at all times. A high end weapon deals FOUR damage dice and you can add more with elemental damage runes. Does a 4d12+3d6 greatsword sound like it doesn't scale well? And that's without ability scores, weapon specialization or class abilities. A level 20 giant instinct barbarian can deal like 4d12 + 3d6 + 29 damage per attack. Which admittedly is near the top end, but significantly more than you can do in 5e.

Also, casters aren't great at damage in PF2. A caster will nearly never outdamage a dedicated martial when it comes to killing stuff.

Rogues can apply sneak attack multiple times per turn unlike 5e. They are among the best damage dealers in the game (if built and played well) and are the master of skills.

Bottom line: forget everything you know from 5e, **especially** when it comes to numbers. None of your experiences with 5e will translate well into PF2."
2229,0.013539266772568226,0.3332877457141876,0.6531730890274048,"So first off, welcome to 2E, I hope you have a great time with the system.

As for martial scaling, martials are designed to deal significant single target damage, and be a sort of buffer for the squishy DPS or caster classes. A fighter is not expected or designed to be able to handle a ton of little guys, but to make it extremely hard to attack supports.

Rogues are powerful, and can deal significant damage with their sneak attack. In addition they can apply status penalties to enemies with diffrent skills, and even circumvent combat entirely. At higher levels they also get debilitating strike, which aids allies as well.

As for 2 weapon fighting, yes I admit it is mostly for rangers and fighters. However if that is a style of fighting you enjoy, may I reccomend taking a look at the dual weapon warrior archetype.

As for multistrikes, in other systems the best strategy was to walk up and hit things. 2E and Paizo wanted to avoid this and implemented 3 interesting ideas to make the 3 actions interesting and dynamic.

1. The multiple attack penalty encourages players to stack benefits rather than attack multiple times. Because 10 over AC is a crit even if the die doesnt land on a 20, you can stack benefits to MAKE a crit. Since crits are double damage, you want to crit.

2. Enemies dont have reactions. While some enemies have a reaction, it is usually about one third of all enemies, and a smaller fraction of that is a reaction on movement. 2E wants you to dance around the battlefield and position yourself, as well as stratagise with your allies.

3. Flanking. When you flank opposite sides of an enemy, you and your ally are flanking, which reduces the enemy's AC by 2, which increases your CRIT CHANCE by 10%. Need I say more?

While there are bonuses to ranged combatants, there are also bonuses to melee combatants. Flanking, abilities that have a maximum range, athletic manuevers, reactions, and melee specific abilities like power attack or spellstrike make melee combat interesting and effective. Plus ranged damage is more limited than melee, considering the highest range damage (with exceptions) is a d8, and the highest melee damage is a d12, plus strength.

And casters being stronger than martials is just not so. Casters do get a leg up in damage, admittedly. But if they cast a spell using a spell slot, they cannot do that level of damage anymore, while martials can. Not only this, casters damage and accuracy upgrades automatically. Martials are expected to have runes on their weapons and armor to give them a boost to damage, accuracy, armor class, and saves. Plus casters are meant to be masters of debuffs, buffs, support and area damage. Single target spells or spells that do high single target damage are far and few between.

I hope this helps. DMs are open and I would love to talk more. Happy adventuring!"

At first glance, it might look like magic damage scales way faster, if you just read the classes. But if you add in the magic tune system, martials also get extra die to their damage. So a 4th level fighter with a striking rune on their greatsword would deal 2d12 +str



For example, my lvl crossbow 4 ranger, through a combination of a striking rune, hunters edge precision damage, the gravity weapon focus spell, and the crossbow feat, deals 3d8 + 6 damage per round, an average of 18 points. A magic user would have a hard time matching that consistently. 



Also I’d avoid making direct comparisons to class power level between 5e and PF2e, it doesn’t really make sense because they classes are balanced in the context of their own systems, not against eachother. You can make broad statements, but comparing rogue sneak attack for example doesnt always tell the whole story"

A big thing about making the jump is that you can't assume things work like they used to in 5e. To go through your concerns one by one:

* Martials scale well, but a lot of that comes from magic equipment. The game considers weapons with potency and striking runes basically mandatory to work as intended, so every martial will have the chance to get additional damage dice on their weapons aside from their various damage-boosting base abilities (Rage, Sneak attack, higher proficiency in fighter's case, etc.) and weapon specialization
* Rogue sneak attacks are lower compared to 5e, but sneak attack isn't 1/turn and they also get striking runes.
* Fighter, Ranger and Rogue (see Twin Feint) have the easiest time with being a two weapon fighter, but anyone else can get some solid feats to enable it using the Dual-Weapon Warrior archetype.
* You do indeed just not get better at making more attacks. You're meant to do 1 or 2, as attacking at -10 is practically worthless, and use the remaining actions to set yourself and your teammates up for success. **Teamwork and supportive actions are far more important than in 5e, you can no longer gague a martial'S contribution with raw damage numbers.** You instead have a low number of high-powered attacks all throughout. The damage of attacks increases, not their amount.
* Ranged combatants have less damage than melee combatants. You do not add dexterity to damage in this game.
* Note that a large number of spells in pf2e have been significantly nerfed when compared to 5e, and that monsters have strong saving throws.
* If you have further questions or want to talk more about how the game works, feel free to hit me up on Discord, I got some time to kill"

As well as what? Most of them get to Master proficiency in their core abilities. Fighter even takes it a step further to Legendary, such that it's considered a very mechanically powerful class almost purely for this reason.

Spellcasters also aren't reality warpers like they are in non-4E D&D, and their DCs and ability acquisition scale more slowly than martials generally do (at level 7 vs. level 5, for example.)

>rogues seem to be considerably weaker.

5E Rogue is very one-note on ""move and sneak attack."" 2E Rogues also want sneak attacks, but they are fluidly tactical characters with a variety of playstyles. You can also feel the skill monkeying they do much better in Pathfinder 2E, where they may not be the absolute best at their respective skills, but they become incredibly good at multiple skills and earn extra skill feats to actually make use of them. They're very useful out of combat.

>I also don't get how do you do a two weapon fighter without being fighter or ranger

Many people in this thread are discussing the general benefits of using agile or twin weapons, but I'll give you a more direct answer. You can exchange class feats for archetype feats in Pathfinder 2E, and one archetype available to all characters is the [Dual-Weapon Warrior](https://2e.aonprd.com/Archetypes.aspx?ID=57) archetype.

You're not going to be great at it without having martial proficiencies on your class, but, for example, this opens up opportunities for Barbarians, Magi, and other classes reaching master proficiency in certain weapons to do respectably well at dual-wielding.

>Rules for multiattacking, as well, seem to mean you don't really get better at making more attacks

You can get better at them by taking feats that skirt MAP (such as the Double Slice feat innate to the archetype above,) acquiring agile attacks, acquiring status and circumstance bonuses to attack rolls, and more. In a very extreme case, [one Ranger subclass straight up nerfs MAP in your preferred combat circumstances, complete with scaling at higher levels of weapon proficiency.](https://2e.aonprd.com/HuntersEdge.aspx?ID=1)

Think outside the box a little bit. Think about how to acquire the above stuff and browse feats and spells with that intent.

>and the whole system seems to greatly favour ranged combatants over melee

Ranged damage *usually* kind of sucks, even if you build into it. Pathfinder 2E enforces a trade between damage and levels of risk quite often. The converse aspect of this maxim is that something as risky as Rage, which decreases your AC, improves melee damage significantly.

>and spellcaster greatly over martials

You'll actually see real players of the system occasionally, though unintelligently, arguing the inverse, particularly where boss fights are concerned. Spellcasters are more supportive and combat-oriented than in non-4E D&D, rather than oppressive and reality-warping."
2236,0.2338259369134903,0.732157289981842,0.03401687741279602,"I dont really know much about the scaling, as I havent played past 6th level.

About rogues, their sneak attack is weaker, but you can proc it multiple times per round. 

About spellcaster vs martials, at early levels martials do significantly more damage than casters. And casters are in general more about healing and utility, compared to 5e.

Two weapon fighting only works if you get a feat for it. IIRC rogues, rangers and fighters can all choose such a feat at first level. 

Ranger and Fighter can both get feats to get better attacking multiple times per round. In different ways though."

I'm having trouble deducing the chain of logic that could have led you there, so I'm not even sure how to help.

To be fair I haven't touched 5e in about 3 years since discovering PF2e so my familiarity with that system is fading."

The core concept is that you can get power in exchange for breadth. Characters that can only do a few things, will do those things better than anything characters who can do many things can do. The difference isn't huge, but in this system ±1 makes a real difference."

They add extra weapon dice instead of the weaker and more boring +1 to damage. So at level four your long sword should be hitting for 2D8 plus whatever if you get a striking rune. This increases a longswords damage by an average of 4.5 instead of 1 like how other systems do.

Free damage boost in weapon specialization also gets thrown in to help a bit but I notice it’s a greater percentage increase for ranged attacks. 

Everyone else seems to have explained the rest of it but believe me when I say that martials are the bringer of single target damage. The one thing that gets in the way is resistances. Since martials are physical damage, they run into the more common physical resist more often but there can be ways around it."

So eventually your rogues short sword does 2d6 instead of 1d6, then 3d6 and so on."
2241,0.1662343591451645,0.7254771590232849,0.10828854143619537,"I think the answer to your confusion comes from items called Runes. Runes can be attached to weapons and armor to give them a permanent boost. The primary ones for weapons are Potency and Striking. Armor also gets Potency and Resilience for its other type.

Potency runes give the item a +1 item bonus to hit (weapons) or AC (armor). Striking gives an additional damage die. Resilience gives a bonus to saving throws if I'm remembering correctly. There are also higher power versions of these, and characters are balanced around receiving them at the appropriate levels. So, a level 2 character should have a +1 Potency rune on their primary weapon. A level 4 character should have a Striking rune. And so on for +2 Potency, Greater Striking, +3 Potency, and I forget what the highest tier striking rune is called.

But, the short version of all of this is that higher level martials will have an additional +1, +2, or+3 item bonus to hit above low level martials, as well as a second, third, and fourth damage die.

As for ranged weapons, they don't add damage from ability scores, while melee weapons add strength to damage. Helps to balance out melee weapons vs ranged.

And yes, two-weapon fighting is a bit clunky, but there are feats from various classes that you can take to make it less so. Rangers are definitely the best two weapon fighters in the game. I kinda wish Dual-Weapon Warrior focused more on fighting with two melee weapons instead of a melee weapon and a ranged weapon, though.

And no, you don't really get better at making more attacks, because you're not really supposed to make multiple attacks per round unless you're a flurry ranger. As for rogues seeming weak, remember that the only requirement for Sneak Attack is that the target be flat footed, and you can apply it more than once per turn. So while multiattacking isn't great for accuracy, if you can get a second or even third hit in on an enemy who is flat footed for all of your attacks, you get sneak attack damage on all of them."

Martials are beasts. Like way more damage than casters in general. And not in a bad way. I mean some spells taken individually are tuned down too hard, but overall casters are versatile, flashy, supports with the occasional big YAY moments. Martials tho can actually utilize weapons to their fullest.

Rogues I know less about but they're still good at offense. And have loads of versatility.

Multiple weapons is the only thing here that I can see being an issue. So dual wielding in PF2E is purely for flavor unless you are being specific about certain choices.

For example, let's say you are wielding a blunt weapon, if you're offhand weapon has the [parry] trait and has another damage type, you can get an AC bonus from your offhand while also guaranteeing you have a fall back weapon if bludgeoning damage is ever the wrong choice.

Also having a [Deadly d...] Trait on your main swinger and then using something like a one handed trip weapon as your offhand. Make your first attack with no penalty with the weapon that has boosted crit damage (from Deadly) and then keep your options open for combat maneuvers.

Traits on weapons and class feats are extremely important for context.

Also ranged is way less powerful than melee in DamagePerTurn. Guns are monsters on a critical hit however. Ranged is balanced for lower damage and a safer range."

Fighter is one of the strongest classes in the game, at low and high level. Everyone scales, it's part of the system. Barbarians and monks are *great*

>Rogues seem to be considerably weaker. 

Rogues are incredibly powerful, they shit out huge amounts of damage and cover many skill angles. And skills are more useful in this game. The rogue in the game I run for is *the* dps of the party.

> the whole system seems to greatly favour ranged combatants over melee

Ranged characters typically do less damage than melee characters, across the board.

>and spellcaster greatly over martials

This is....not at all true.  This goes against common narrative, extended shared play experience, and personal experience.

I strongly recommend leaving your 5e knowledge at the door, it will actively hurt you if you try to assume things about 2e based on it."

Fighters have the highest bonus to attack rolls, they incredibly likely to crit on the first attack, and hit on the 2nd still.

Every other martial is just below the fighter in terms of Attack Roll bonus, the 1d20 + bonus + item

Barbarians are flavorful and deal good damage when they hit. They also gain resistances and special abilities depending on their Instinct. So the Dragon Barbarian gets a breath attack

Rogues use feints, trips, and more to deal Sneak attack upwards of 2x per round. Positioning is key and using strategy is important

Swashbuckler's Panache is insane, easy to get consistently, and they are the martial with a wide variety of mental effects to impart into your foe

Thaumaturge finds or creates weaknesses, so your overall damage isn't too impressive on its own, but once you have a foe's weakness, you can tear them apart.

Alchemist is technically a martial with supporting abilities. Buffing allies/healing others, or just being the AoE Martial which vs swarms, all other martials struggle unless they have cleave

Investigator is an Intelligent Martial, and is honestly the least impressive at melee range. I've done Investigator/Ranger before and it worked really well with a bow and a few spells to open the door for high damage/assisting my team.

Champion isn't much of a damage dealer, you are a wall with healing options. Your damage isn't your focus, it's being the wall of meat and metal the gives your allies the bulwark they need to pump

And then there's the Monk, which is the agile version of the Barbarian where you do cool abilities and effects depending on which stance you go.

Ranger is consistent ranged damage, your MAP can be -3/-6 which is insane for attacking your Prey/Focused target. Your pet can also be commanded to do have some flavorful/tactical options as well

If I missed any others, it's cause I haven't played them. I've seen Oracles of Battle do some serious work too"

Another factor you maybe haven't considered is enchanted weapon scaling. As you get to higher levels, you gain access to various levels of Striking runes, which multiply the base number of damage die you throw (ex: dealing 4d6 damage with a shortsword without a crit). Also only the most expensive rune counts when figuring out what level of item it counts as. In addition, Martials and Ranged combatants scale their to-hits at roughly the same rate as casters do with their spells (stat+level+ trained level). For example, say a level 4 character with 4 Str had expert training in melee: that'd be +12 to hit (4Str, lvl4, +4 from Expert). If its a Ranger with Flurry edge and Agile weapons, then there's the added benefit of having reduced hit penalties (going as far down as -1 per attack)

To close, ranged non-casters have to be wary of classes like Fighter and Champion, who get reactions to manipulate actions and attacks through their unique feats and class features"

If the initial court felt there was enough evidence to convict,  and the appeal to the Crown Court felt there was enough to convict (keeping in mind the appeal was a complete re-hearing) then the chance of it being overturned is very low.

We recently traded in a car with a balance owed of 36k that was worth about 68k. We bought a used car for 40k and used the 32k in equity plus a check for 8k to buy the used car. 

This was all done at the dealership. They said they would handle the loan payoff for the trade in (credit union has title) and transfer at the DMV. The had us fill out DMV paperwork and then moved our plate from our trade in to our new to us used car.  

Fast forward three weeks and our loan at the credit union isn’t paid off and the new used car isn’t showing up in our DMV online account but old trade is still is.  We have not received the title for the new car either. 

We’ve contacted the dealer and haven’t had a response. 

What’s your take in this situation? Think we’re being screwed? Three weeks not long enough to update DMV and pay off loan??

I’m not sure wha to think. Never had a transaction take this long before.

Quick question. Why is that ridiculous? You're a high risk borrower, like it or not. I was in the same situation many moons ago. I ended up with a 16% loan from BOA. I made the payments, refinanced it a year later at 3% and never looked back.

Now, 20 years later, I have a huge credit history in the US, a 830 FICO, almost $500k in available credit and guess what? I'm back in my home country and can't get a decent loan for anything because I have no credit history. Tough."

Hi People

I am a 24 year old in USA, I have been in the USA for few months and I need a used car badly for my new full time job. I am looking for a car that is worth about 15-20k. I can put down about 6k for down payment. 

Here is my problem: I only have a credit history for 2 months due to my getting 2 credit cards about 2 months ago. I do have rental and other payment histories for 8 months, where I never missed a payment and always paid everything in full. Because of this, I have no credit score whatsoever but I do need financing. I make about 95k pre-tax yearly and have no current loans in the USA (other than credit cards with the balance paid off). What are my options for financing, I do not want to pay 15 to 20% APR which is ridiculous? I did have a decent credit score in Canada (low 700) but sadly credit score doesn't transfer over to USA. Any advice would help regarding a loan for about 10K. I do not care about the monthly payment, I just do not want to pay insane interests. Thank You.

Plus older cars are usually at the flat part of the depreciation curve, so you probably won’t even lose that much doing it this way unless you get unlucky with a major repair."

A weapon's performance depends largely on the user, but also runes can tip the scales a little.

A fighter or a gunslinger, who both have +2 accuracy over everyone else will hit and crit more often than anyone else with the same weapon.

Now some other classes have abilities that can make it easier, like bards who can inspire courage, or wizards who can cast fear, but by and large it is based on the skills of the user, not the weapon.

It's based on 1e. Pretty true to form. Basically none of your knowledge is useful. 

You crit by exceeding the DC by 10. Rolling a natural 20 is not a crit as such, it upgrades the degree of success by 1. So if the DC is 25 and you have a +6 and you roll a natural 20, that's 26, which would be a success. Upgrade the degree of success by 1 because of a natural 20 and you get a critical success.

On the other hand, if the DC is 30, that 26 is a failure. Upgrade the degree of success by 1 and you get a normal success on a natural 20."

I know there were classes that specialize in ""crit fishing"", but I am curious if any common weapons have crit ranges, where you can crit on a 19 on the die as well or if that's just a class thing?

Class thing. Crit fishing involves rolling LOTS (or a couple very accurate) of attack dice for a better chance at getting a high roll, not necessarily JUST a 20. 

    I'm sure that game is either based on 1e or just has a bunch of balance changes for a video game

Kingmaker is 1e. It's VERY different from 2e, but mostly on point for 1e."
2347,0.09984161704778671,0.7856439352035522,0.11451444029808044,"Kingmaker the video game is 1e.   


Various effects in 1e granted what was called 'threat range', which made critical hits more   
likely. Some of those effects were class abilities, but there was also a weapon trait, 'Keen', that made hits more likely - IIRC those effects could stack with each other.  


'Crit fishing' being viable is usually more a matter of what happens during the crit -   


Some abilities caused conditions or did extra bonus damage, so for those builds, you could try to build to maximize their chances of critting, which almost always boiled down to ""keen weapons are super good"" and ""always do the thing that gives you the most attacks per round"" - in extreme cases you would stop caring about to-hit bonus entirely and just sacrifice all +hit in favor of trying to roll a crit score on the die as many times as possible.   


EG, you stop caring that you can only match the AC on a roll of 19 or higher if you crit on a roll of 16 or higher and deal 3x as much damage as a hit, or if 'doing damage' isn't something your character is good at anyway and what you're really going for is applying some kind of status debuff.  


Critical hits work totally differently in second edition.  
How critical hits work in PF2e, in full:  


**Critical Success:** Your score on a check beats the DC by 10 or more

**Success:** Your score on a check beats or matches the DC

**Failure:** Your score is less than the DC

**Critical Failure:** Your score is less than the DC by 10 or more

  
**Special:** On a die roll of 20, increase the level of success by one. On a die roll of 1, decrease the level of success by one.

  
Critical failures typically have no additional effect on attack rolls, critical success means you deal twice as much damage.  


So, assuming a level 0 character with 10 strength who is untrained at unarmed (IE, +0 to hit):  


AC 8 - You crit on 18,19, or 20

AC 10 - You crit only on 20

AC 12 - You still crit only on 20

AC 21 - You can only hit on a natural 20, you cannot crit

AC 31 - Any roll except a natural 20 is a critical fail, and the nat 20 is still a fail.  


So if you could hit on a die roll of 10 or lower, anything that affects hit chance or lowers AC also increases crit range, and vice versa.  


PF2e also introduces something called the 'Multiple Attack Penalty', which is an increasing accuracy debuff that compounds the more attacks you make in a round - and, characters generally just get fewer opportunities to make attacks than they did in 1e.   


This turns 'crit fishing' into a pretty sub-optimal build strategy - although there are some effects that will give you the 'nat 20' effect on a roll of 19, the over all effect ends up being more like: ""sometimes it might be a reasonable option to attack more than twice in a round because hey, you might crit."""

the crit ranges happen naturally from level and bonus difference  - that is essentially what the DC+10 does is multiply the range of d20 that you can crit.  This is why +1 is powerful in pf2e - assuming you would have crit on a 20 you doubled your chances by critting on a 19 as well.

critical effects on weapons give you something special that can happen.  An example is light mace has the club critical effect which means you can use it as a baseball bat and shove them back for free.  And like a true baller - you get to point out where you are going to knock them out of the park.  The shove trait itself just means they can use an action to shove so is not as good, but still better than having to drop your weapon to shove.  But you do not start out knowing how to use crit effects it comes online later.

the nat20 is still respected by upgrading the success level of the DC result.   Though against extreme bosses a nat20 may simply move you from a crit fail to a fail!"

My young dog is a scream first and ask questions later sort of dog, and what has made a huge difference in her life is teaching her the look at that protocol. It's really helped me figure out what her triggers are, and what distance she can handle things from. So I don't just expect her to either have a meltdown or ignore things: at this point I know pretty far in advance what her reaction will be. 

When she was younger, she'd have about an hour before bedtime where she would spiral up and up and up and not be able to calm down. I invented Bone Time. She knows that one really well now: she'll keep telling me about the freezer, and I'll walk over, take out a frozen bone, and we'll go back to her crate and she gets to be in there with the bone for half an hour or so. When she was a baby, she'd fall asleep in there, but now she'll chew on it, and after half an hour or so, her brain returns and we can all coexist. 

Sometimes less is more: if a young dog can't settle, sometimes you have to give them a good reason to settle as well as removing choice about it, while still making it an attractive option."

From what I ve learned and seen so far and as far as I can tell from your post, you might want to check if your dog is actually getting enough rest. Dogs that age need around 20 hours of rest every day. It sounds like you’re doing everything you can to satisfy her need for activity and attention, but if you keep doing that, you might end up with a hyperactive, nervous, (worst case) aggressive dog. Just because a high level of excitement means more stress hormones. 
Plus, of course, 10.5 months is brutal. Everything in your dog’s brain is being rearranged and sorted through. It’s simple chemistry that she cannot perform the way she used to. You’re competing against a world full of smells and sounds, her growing interest in everything - it’s not easy for her either. Try not to expect too much from her, and try to help her as best you can to go through this phase. 
Take it easy. You don’t need long training sessions, and don’t be ashamed to go back to a lower level in your training schedule. It’s going to be ok. :)

Edit: sorry about spelling or grammar errors, English is not my first language…"

Try sitting down at a bench or something and just observe with the pup, praise and treats when she is calm and relaxed. It might bew a few moments only, but if you time it right it will have an impact :)   
Best of luck! :)"

I think she was just born that way/ prone to high intensity, since other dogs I had years ago were never on her level!

From puppy the way I managed it was socialising her (a lot!) literally taking her to a dog park or open area every day for an hour so she could run around and get all that high social and physical stimulation she seems to need, as well as more structured retrieving exercises, training, and morning walks. Some dogs just had different needs (and I think it's also linked to intelligence!).

She's 2,5 years old now and can still be a hyper ball of nerves and excitement when overstimulated - but it got so much better after about 1,5 years. I do see her calming down more in the next few years as well - consider that this may just be a bit of a rough patch to get through as your dog grows.

One other thing that helped me was getting another (senior) dog who is much calmer, but still plays with her daily and helps drain some of her energy, but also gives her a bit more confidence/ direction when she's pacing and feeling all over the place. I don't know if that would be workable for you since you already don't have a lot of space, but it did help my dog also not to hyper-focus only on me. My senior dog sleeps half the day away and taught my dog that afternoon naps can be good too!

Hang in there, it sounds like you're doing everything you can! We all go through tough times."

For yourself, it sounds like you have a lot of goals on your plate with this pup - maybe sports? This is a good time to re-evaluate priorities. What do you want to work on right now that would make life better for you and pup? Put as much as you can to the side. Forget about cues like sit/down/heel - you can work on those any time. 


I almost wonder if pup is having too much training? No one likes being in class all day. When does dog get to dog? And I don’t mean high arousal situations like dog parks. Think of sniffing and exploring and digging.  

Nosework - not the sport per se but exercises that encourage the dog to use their nose can be wonderful for overstimulated, reactive dogs. I really recommend pursuing this avenue and working on sniffing games inside and out. As well, try paying attention to your walks - how much time is spent sniffing vs looking around and reacting to the environment? 

BAT 2.0 - familiar with this program? If not I recommend reading up on it and seeing if that’s something you want to pursue. Definitely recommend working with a trainer if so. 

Medication - if the issues are really resistant to training and conditioning, don’t feel that this is a last resort. It can help an anxious dog manage their anxiety so they can actually focus and learn. 

Keep at it - this dog is lucky to have an owner so dedicated to figuring out how to help them have a good quality of life."

Hey All,

I went to a local Mazda dealership, bought a new 2022 Mazda CX-5 (it had 20 miles on it) and decided to pay outright for it without financing. I traded in my car (worth about $3000) and paid $11,000 using my debit card. My debit card had a transaction limit which is why I could not pay more that day. The people at the dealership said I could drive the car off the lot and pay the remaining balance within a week. I returned to the dealership 2 days later, after I increased my debit card transaction limit, and paid off the remaining balance.

Looking over the title registration paperwork, I see the dealer listed "" Toyota Motor Credit Corporation "" as the lienholder. I did NOT finance the car however. Can someone explain how a new car that is paid for without financing still have a lienholder? Thanks

It has not been the subject of any credible peer-reviewed scientific research. It is not listed in either of the top two psychiatric diagnostic manuals, the DSM or ICD. It has been propagated solely through blogs and the internet by William Dodson, who coined the term in the context of ADHD. This means that Dodson, his explanation of these experiences, and claims about how to treat it all warrant healthy skepticism.

Here are some scientific articles on ADHD and rejection:

* [Rejection sensitivity and disruption of attention by social threat cues](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2771869/)
* [Justice and rejection sensitivity in children and adolescents with ADHD symptoms](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24878677/)
* [Rejection sensitivity and social outcomes of young adult men with ADHD](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17242422/)

We do not want to minimise or downplay your feelings, and we find that many people use RSD as a shorthand for this shared experience of struggling with emotions.

His company gets hired to come into a new, empty office, and sit down with you to consult - every chair, every desk, every lamp, ever filing cabinet, etc. He gets paid on the price of the stuff PLUS most of that is leased so he gets paid on the spread, along with back end products like wear and tear protection, etc.

He works normal office hours - 9 to 5."

Truthfully, after working retail hours from the time I was in high school until my mid-20’s, I was pretty burned out and wanted a change of pace. Plus I was at a MINI dealer, so it wasn’t like we were super high volume anyway. There were definitely parts of the job I actually did like, but they were being increasingly outweighed by me not wanting to stay in it long term. I had looked at moving into corporate with the brand but there just weren’t any opportunities available, so I looked outside the auto industry and found a place I’m very much happy at. I hadn’t had a weekend off in like 5 years, and hadn’t had consecutive weekends off since I was probably 17 lol. So it was a good change for me. Congrats on your son by the way, that’s awesome and good on you for wanting to spend more time with him. As the child of a police officer growing up, it definitely is hard when they aren’t around, no matter how much they may want to be."

I am a new father who is looking for more work life balance to spend more time with my newborn son. Been in luxury car sales for over two years and while I do love it, the hours are taking me away from watching my son grow up. The late night have been increasingly hard since I am needed at home to help with a newborn but gotta pay the bills. Fiancé understands that I need to work but at the same point I feel bad I have to dump it all on her while chasing leads, wrangling floor mats, etc. 

Has anyone had any success transitioning from luxury auto sales to other careers? I know that sales is sales but I am curious if anyone in here has had a simile problem and what they did. Thanks in advance for the help. Looking to make a move early next year after the holiday busy season.

Improve your income for the next 12 months - get a second job, third job, fourth job, sell the cat, tell the partner no more movies and dinner out - you get the idea - find that income and pay it all on the car debt.

In 12 months, refinance the car at a lower rate - with a much lower balance - at a credit union or bank you like. Just walk in and ask about refinancing a car loan.  
In a perfect world, keep up that formula and pay all your debt off.   
It's my person opinion $450-$500 a month from $662 isn't going to be life changing, but you'll have much less car and paying more interest on neg equity. With this plan, in 12 months you could cut the payment in half maybe on a shorter term at a better rate."

Hiya! So I have a '22 Kia Forte GT and a LOT has changed since I got it in February. It almost has 4k miles on it and there was a period I lost my job so i couldn't make payments. I have a 20% apr and my balance went from $26k to $29k. I've found another job but was told to get a cheaper car so that it's easier on my score and wallet. The dealers I've been to so far claim they can't roll the remaining owed balance after my trade in on a new loan, but others also tell me that isn't true? Is there a specific way to go about this, or should I just chip away at the interest rate? Thank you in advance! (If it means anything I'm financing through Santander)

The idea of Luke and Ben travelling the galaxy and meeting/learning from other cultures is great (it's just missing Mara) and would have been a fine idea for a book series composed of self contained adventures. I also have always wanted a story about Jacen's five year study of the force.

Even the other masters having to face a crisis without Luke to guide them is a great idea. What I've always missed in the EU is having more of a spotlight on some of the other jedi.

But damn... reading about >!the jedi turning on each other inside the jedi temple culminating in the death of the acting Grand Master!< was a very bad experience."

FOTJ I read at a time where my interest in the main EU series had waned massively. I'd resigned myself to ""*It's trash, but they have to keep making it to justify and balance the more experimental EU stuff, which is great, but can't sell as well*"". So I read it once, mostly with audio books helping, and forgot about them. But it's interesting to me that what bothered me about them aren't in your criticisms:

* Jacen's ""reason for going dark"" that showed the author doesn't understand the original criticisms against his stupid plot point
* Tedious internal strife in the Jedi order
* Anything Daala
* Tahiri's stupid trial

But this:

>We can't say this anymore. Apocalypse claims Anakin failed because he let the Ones die, and now Chaos reigns and will do so forever

Is why FOTJ should be tossed into the bin by EU continuity buffs. I remember reading - and annoyingly have lost - the original EU mission statement which was, I paraphrase, *to expand the world of the movies with changing or subverting the meaning of those films*. FOTJ, like LOTF, are massively subversive of this. It shouldn't have been allowed. It isn't *true* EU.

I genuinely don't understand what possessed LFL Licencing from 2005 onwards, but with Lucas himself having much bigger fish to fry, and Luceno giving up his quarterback role, it's sort of the equivalent of Sir Alex Ferguson retiring and what happened to Man Utd in the decade following."

Like someone did ctrl + R with *too* for the all the uses that should have been *also*, or like she thought that when people start a sentence listing items or reasons they’re saying *too* instead of *two* for the second one.

It was so jarring to me, on top of the crappy storyline and directions it just took me over the top. I’m with you, I’ve never read a series that made me *so angry* and I thought the replacement of Anakin with Jacen for NJO’s hero only to be followed by Cadeus stuff was the worst it could get. It was not.

This is why one of my favorite lines in the new trilogy is “let the past die. Kill it, if you must.” I’m not getting into new canon but I’m glad this crap is Legends now."

First I felt that the politics are horrible, too much without do anything because. This is best seen by Daala by the end of Omen the politics have told you everything about Daala and it never stops until she is removed at least until she tries to take over the Remnant. In LOTF, I think Exile or Sacrifice Jacen is musing about his political power and gives an insight into his character same for Niathal come Revelations. Also I found things were dragged out for  far to long  with in Allies the temple is sieged B5 and by B7 Daala is kicked out by a coup after removing the mandolarians in B6.

To give FOTJ credit Ben and Luke Skywalker relationship is great especially in light of LOTF and Vestara is so good, her character makes sense and grows appropriately until to the end Acsension when she reverts to herself to her Omen to probably Allies self. Acsension Vestara before the mission to Upbezkar is brilliant.

To conclude while I'll never claim LOTF to be perfect however it's the lesser of the two evils when in comparison to FOtJ in my opinion.

Thanks for reading my rant."

The duty is to ensure best value for creditors, and if the thing was going to be liquidated otherwise, with no other buyers, then usually a pre-pack will satisfy that.

In terms of furlough - as there was no money claimed from HMRC that is not an issue, it is simply whether contractual arrangements were followed.

If there was a clause allowing furlough, then that will essentially be that. If not, then the question will be whether there was an offer to reduce salary by 50% and if that was accepted by staff. They will say people continued to work there on the lower salary. You will say, we protested and do not accept this. The staff would have to sue for the deductions from the purported salary.

The issue with funding etc., not relevant. Creditors got wiped because that's the point of a pre-pack. Their route was to challenge the actions of the administrator, but they didn't so, that's on them."

it's possible that after playing for a while, like myself and others, you may realize that ""official 40K"" ... isn't actually all that fun. Also the constantly changing rules  may get frustrating.

There are many options for stripping paint. For plastic minis you can use Dettol, Simple Green, LA's Totally Awesome, Isopropyl Alcohol or specialist solutions like [Paint Blitzer](https://untothebreachhobbies.com/product/paint-blitzer/). For metal miniatures you can also use Acetone.

If you choose to use a product like Dettol or Simple Green, you will usually need to soak the minis for up to 24 hours in order to successfully remove the paint. After the models have soaked, use an old toothbrush to scrub the paint off the minis.

Basically what that means is when you defer/extend a payment, you accrue additional interest through your extension period, which you pay the interest on your next bill AFTER the extension.. but people forget you get hit double interest at the end of the loan. It's a double whammy because interest really never stops accruing on an account. If it takes you 20 days to pay those extra months off, they should only charge 20 days of interest and the rest towards principle... something that should have been explained to you by your lender BEFORE you agreed to those extensions."

I had a new car financed for 72 months. Originally, the loan was suppose to mature 4/2022 but I had a few deferments and now the maturity date is 9/2022. Although there have been several months where I have been late, I've always paid the late fees plus regular payment. According to the finance company, I have no late fees or arrears due but I still owe $5100 with a monthly payment of $678. How is this possible? I have asked them to explain how I can still owe so much if I don't owe any late fees or arrears and they can't explain it, they just tell me to keep paying the monthly payment until the balance is paid off. Any ideas?

But I am also someone who's thinking about going to Germany and I think I can help with the language part with my advice. I am a huge nerd about language learning and how it happens, and the truth is that learning a language is only dictated by how much you immerse in it, i.e., listen to it. Not read books, not speak (you are actually discouraged from speaking at first) but just LISTEN. This technique(s) is collectively is called input based language learning, which is different from the output based leaning the school system uses which is generally taught as the ""norm"". The ironic thing is reserch from a lot of people, especially from an individual named Stephen Krashen (available on yt) shows how well it works while for the output based methods there's very less evidence of it being as efficient as input based methods. Those numbers you see in those websites tell you nothing. It's just very vague. You don't need teachers, nor specialized grammer books to learn a language, you just have to listen to it.

Language learning isn't truly hard, think about it, why tf would a language survive if it's actually as hard as people say it were? Every Japanese person knows how to write 3-4 thousand Kanji no matter how stupid they are. I won't write much more. But [go to this website.](https://refold.la/introduction) It's not the best way but it's THE easiest way of input based learning. Once you finish the roadmap go to the main discord server with the link in the website and then enter the discord server that is specifically made for German through it. The method might not be that great but because of good reputation of the servers a lot of great people are in them who constantly help learners, any problem you face is bound to get fixed in there.

About going to Germany or not, I guess you should actually go. You definitely will face a culture shock but remember, Germany is much more developed than India so it's atleast better that what we are used to (not great all the time but definitely better than here). Honestly I am also gonna take a drop year because I wasted 11 and I am learning everything from scratch (I am incapable of cheesing through stuff unless I truly understand it. I tried but I have to do everything from start). College is worthless most of the times, that's why a lot of people say that you can find everything in the internet (atleast for CS). People there are much more forward thinking and don't give a shit about degree if you have experience/quality to show. But not having a degree still makes things difficult so a lot of the students go to college for that and kinda hate it (because 3 years is still quite a lot of time, after also calculating the 13 years of schooling there). It's not that bad, you can increase the duration of your course if you want. They give that much flexibility atleast.

Bdw, how are you gonna go to Germany without something to account for the 13th year of school? One way is to study 1 year in H+ credited college in India and that counts and another is to pass JEE Advanced (not sure if this is relevant now). Is there something else I missed?"

Try to learn as much german as you can while in India as it will help you a lot but don't be stressed about it as you can find english courses over there as well and your aim in India while learning german should be to speak common words and understand people once you start interacting over there it will become much more easy for you."

Actually that's where you are wrong OP.

See the thing is , in Germany , there is an school system of 13 years of education. While in India, we have 12. *So you need to do 1 year of Studienkolleg in Germany first for which you first have to give entrance exam called Aufnahmerprufung . And then you will get admission , but the seats inevery Studienkolleg are very less. And the exam is in German language (till level B2 is required then)*


So keep in mind to AT LEAST LEARN TILL B2 LEVEL GERMAN"

Hello! Just bought a new car and the dealer offered me well below KBB for my car. I got an appraisal from carmax a month ago and it was way more reasonable.

I have $2k owed on the car and was wondering if I should pay it off before trying to sell or if I should try to sell it with the lien and have the buyer work with the payoff. I have a payoff quote from my lender Im just worried I pay it off and it takes weeks to get the cleared title or letter acknowledging its paid off. 

Which should I do?

Name: Indigo Reid 

Nickname: Indie 

Age: 19

Gender: Female 

Occupation: Uni Student, Drag Queen & Model 

FYM link: https://imgur.com/a/pmJa5C8

Personality: Indie is described to portray the perfect balance between kindness and sass. She is extremely humorous. Indie makes it clear that when she cares for someone, she’d be willing to give her life for them if she had too & displays a very positive attitude and can brighten a room whenever she walks into it and is also very very charismatic. She also finds 60% of males she lays her eyes on very attractive. Though she doubts herself a lot of time, and sometimes can be seen as a bit too loud. She is also extremely ambitious and will make sure she achieves what she wants. 

Backstory: Indie was born as a male and was raised in Australia. During her childhood years, Indie always had the feeling that she wasn’t born the way she should’ve been.She constantly tried to push these thoughts away but, they would always come back into her mind. While all of this was going on, someone who Indie considered to be one of her best friends, her Nan, was shockingly murdered. With her Nan being murdered and the thoughts of her not being in the right body, Indie tended to overreact quite a bit, and this caused for her to lose a lot of her friends. After a few years of thinking, she was finally at peace with herself being a woman, and she knew she was always a woman. When it came to telling the people she was close too, majority were accepting, but not everyone. Her dad ridiculed her and made fun of her to the point where Indie ran away from home. With all of this happening during her last year of high school, Indie was… struggling a bit, academically, but that didn’t stop her from putting a lot of effort into her school work. Indie graduated, with decent marks, nothing to great, but, built up the courage to move to New York, with not much money. Indie while in there grew a big love for the drag scene and decided to try it. Now, Indie is a quite popular drag queen with the name Doggy Style who is known for posting content on Instagram and Tik Tok. One day, Indie was just scrolling through Facebook, when she saw that Survivor applications were open. She had always been a fan so she decided to apply. Indie would love to go on Survivor so that she can raise trans awareness!!!"

Gender: Female

Occupation: Fire Dancer

FaceYourManga (must be a solid color background!) avatar, or description of the character: https://www.faceyourmanga.com/mangatar.php?id=1875827

Personality: Chaotic, Untrustworthy, Rebellious, Cold-Blooded

Short backstory: In the real world, Gretchen is just your normal Hawaiian native, with an impressive for knack for fire dancing. She lives with her family, loves being on the beach, and is well beloved in the area. But in Survivor she is putting all those morals aside in order to become Sole Survivor. A self confessed Super-Fan, who has watched the show since it’s conception, she doesn’t just want to win, but win in the most explosive and memorable way. She wants to leave a massive trail of destruction in her journey to be the biggest villain. Form alliances, only to betray them. Befriend her fellow castaways, only to snitch on them. Make promises, only to go back on them. Lie about her tribemates to ruin their reputation. Throw challenges to purposefully make her tribe lose. Ruin their stash of food.

Personality: arrogant, evil, hypocritical, intimidating, snobby, selfish, manipulative 

Backstory (optional): Growing up in a very rich Indian family, Waleed was pretty much a golden child and was heavily spoiled and favoured by his parents. He has always taken advantage of their love for him and always got what he wanted out of them. Despite being a spoiled brat, Waleed is very intelligent and loves tormenting others for his own pleasure, from strangers, to “friends” to his own sister. He’s now in law school mainly to make sure he gets his parents’ inheritance but he also loves the idea of being a lawyer so he can intimidate and tear down all sorts of people in the courtroom on a daily basis. Waleed came on Survivor because it’s a game based on lying, manipulating, and beating others, and he finds incredible joy in doing those things : D

Personality: Mimi is nice, extroverted, and has a lot of knowledge on international topics, she loves meeting new people and sharing stories of her adventures around the world. However, even though she has the talent and experience to back it up, she is very eccentric, and quite literally does not know when to shut up, which makes her hard to atture.

Short backstory: Thought born in France, Mimi’s life was always about moving, as her dad runs a world-renowned enterprise, and her mother is a famous model and actress. Traveling around the world gave her the explorative personality that she has today, she’s settled down to live in Paris with no one but her cat, but many times during the year, she packs her bags to travel... wherever she feels like going, she’s rich, she can afford it. She also runs a travel blog that she constantly updates. Nearing her 30’s, She’s set foot on every continent, she can speak so many languages that she’ considered a polyglot and one could say she’s done anything one can think of. Now, she’s set her sights on Survivor, as her explorative side keeps on pushing her to find and learn new things. And what better way to learn more about yourself than to starve on an Island with a bunch of strangers?

FYM: https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/745780177677844765/1009572196085145680/IMG_3768.png

Personality: Very out there, but she was born this way, dramatic, friendly once you get to know her, she is also like sour candy, so sweet till she gets a little angry. 

Backstory: Alice has always been obsessed with Lady Gaga since her first release, Just Dance. She's always found her music as a way to escape her troubled childhood, as her father was an alcoholic and her mother always doubted her. At the age of 16, she ran away to try to pursue a career in singing, just like her idol Lady Gaga. Coincidentally, she fell in love with a boy named Alejandro, who encouraged her to follow her passions. So after that, she released her first YouTube video, a cover of Just Dance. To her surprise, her video went viral. Eventually, her relationship with Alejandro turned into a bad romance, after he cheated on her with a girl named Joanne. But this did not stop Alice, as she continued to post her covers and her fans were very encouraging. Eventually she met with one of her fans, Judas, which despite his name he is very nice to her unlike Alejandro, and this just helped her overcome her struggles even more. Eventually, she legally changed her last name to Chromatica to promote Lady Gaga’s new album and to escape her family name. She has just recently started up the “Lady Gaga Fanclub” and came to Survivor to promote it and her love for Lady Gaga, but a million dollars also sounds good.

Nickname: Janet

Age: 53

Gender: F

Occupation: Cat Caretaker

Personality: A little crazy but nice, obsessed with cats

Backstory: When Janet was younger, she always was fascinated with cats. She would see one at the park she used to go to as a child. But her parents would not let her get one, due to her mom being allergic. This still didn’t stop her obsession, as she would frequent the park just to see the cats there. But what she didn’t realize was she brought back cat fur with her, causing the mom’s allergies to act up, leading her to be hospitalized but able to recover. Janet’s dad was furious with Janet and banned her from ever visiting that park again. This caused Janet to fall into a very depressed state. But once she moved out, things changed. She met her soon to be husband, who liked cats as much as her. At first it was one cat, then another, then magically there was 10 cats living in their house. Come to find out, taking care of cats is expensive and they had no money at the time. So the two ended up having to get rid of the cats so they could afford food. But this obstacle again did not stop Janet. She found that some families in her town needed a cat caretaker, which she gladly took up doing. Now, her and her husband are making enough to have 2 cats instead of 10. Janet, however, wants to win this money to fulfill her dream, to open up a cat cafe in her town

Personality: She thinks she’s smart, but really is anything but. She’s cocky and spoiled.   
Backstory: Flik’s parents were successful computer engineers, so they expected to have a smart daughter. When Flik was 5 and tried to eat her plate, accidentally breaking it and cutting the inside of her mouth, was when her parents realized she wasn’t smart. They refused to admit it though, and so Flik received constant praise for her nonexistent intellect. She’s come to Survivor expecting to dominate the game but could be in for a very rude awakening. She’s had constant praise and high grades (often through less than fair methods) and has never actually had to really work making her a champion.

Image: (Must be FaceYourManga with a \*WHITE\* background): https://img.faceyourmanga.com/mangatars/2/0/2000205/large\_1883904.png  
  
Personality: Likes to steal things to cause chaos, however he will choose to not tell anyone his massive wealth and his less than legal career. Is very intelligent and knows how to cover his tracks well most of the time, but has erratic behaviour that could lead him to creating chaos around camp if he lets it take over him.  
  
Backstory: Sudhir owes his entire life to boats. Well, one single houseboat that carried his ancestors from India to Los Angeles back in the 1930's. His grandfather, a teenager at the time, did a lot of the sailing across the pacific, and as such he became very good at it. He tried to join the Navy to fight for America during the Second World War, but he was denied because of his race. All of this had a huge effect on Sudhir and his brother a few decades later, after their grandfather passed, they both did their best to become some sort of sailors. Amarjeet, Sudhir's brother, went into the Navy to fight in the brewing Gulf War of the early 1990's. Sudhir stayed in Los Angeles and made a lot of money as a luxury boat repairman, being very knowledgeable about how large boats and small ships worked in his favour, and soon he moved up in the corporate ladder, going from a small time worker to a big time CEO of a boat dealership. He began manufacturing speedboats under his company, Upsilon. Around this time, he found out that Amarjeet had died in the Gulf War, and he became extremely emotionally distraught and began distrusting everyone. The 90's carried on, and the 2000's came, and a few months after an attack on the other side of the country, a group of radicals decided to burn his company's only factory down out of fear that he had been building bombs there to take over the government, which he hadn't been. This broke Sudhir, as all his hard work was gone and he had to start fresh. The remaining boats in his dealership were sold, and at this point he was all but done with everything life threw at him. He was still a millionaire, but he longed to rise to as much power as he used to have, so he started to make money again producing yachts out of seemingly thin air, then selling them. He never told them where he got them, and no one suspected that he might have stolen them. His wife was mortified at what he was doing, so she divorced him and never let him see his young son again. Now he lives alone, rich but isolated, selling yachts that he stole from unsuspecting victims. A few weeks ago, he got called by his wife for the first time, and she told him that she's gonna rat him out if he doesn't go on Survivor and win, so Sudhir had a choice to make. Have his secret get leaked to the world, or disappear for a few months and potentially make a fool of himself or get seriously injured.

(I apologize for the low quality picture. I can’t seem to be able to download the FYM itself. Can you just recreate the FYM yourself?)   
  
Personality: Elijah is incredibly savvy when it comes to animals. If you need to know something about a creature he probably knows it and would gladly tell you. He is also very adept at surviving out in the wilderness. His main issue is that he isn’t very knowledgeable on anything else. Yeah, he isn’t the brightest bulb in the shed but he makes up for it by being incredibly charming. Most people he comes across are enamored with his strange but lovable demeanor. He’s also a bit of a ladies man and wants to find a pretty lady to call his own. Although he will try his best not to come across as creepy when he’s flirting.   
  
Short Backstory: Elijah grew up in Australia and was fascinated by animals ever since he was little. Whenever he had the opportunity he would hang out outside and try to befriend various creatures. Unfortunately, his fascination with animals meant that he wasn’t very interested in schoolwork. He grew up just barely passing his classes and although his parents didn’t like him nearly failing every year, they still wanted to support his passion. As he grew up, because of his extensive knowledge of animals he wanted to become a wildlife biologist. He even moved to America to find a good school to help him reach this dream and although he didn’t enjoy the school part of it, he tried his absolute hardest to reach his goal and eventually he did. Today he is a successful Wildlife Biologist and is very happy with where he is. He decided to sign up for Survivor so he could use his knowledge of the outdoors to get himself ahead."

Personality: Chett is a scam artist through and through. Not a single artist that has had their music mixed by him trusts him with anything.

Backstory: Unchetta was born to.... well he doesn't actually know since the earliest memory he knows of is being dropped at an all boys orphanage. Always the king pin at his orphanage, Chett used his quick wit and prowess with technology against the people he lived with. His favorite memory of the orphanage was when he set a child's adoption papers on fire for warmth. When he was too old for the orphanage, Chett scammed a man into a mentorship for sound mixing. When he was done teaching him everything, he took over for him, as the owner died of natural causes. He's now infamous for his no sh*t attitude and for his incident with Cardi B, where she exposed him for ruining her track. Now wanting to show his skills elsewhere, Chett knows he's going to win, no matter what.

Occupation: Wealthy Socialite

Image: https://imgur.com/a/ayVHria (first image)

Personality: Spoiled rich girl who thinks she’s a rebel against society despite being out of touch. She frequently tries to act “inspirational”, spouting “philosophical” quotes and ice-cream koans that only make her sound pretentious. She’s also incredibly self-centered, turning other people’s problems into an excuse to talk about herself. But she isn’t inherently or intentionally malicious, just stupid. 

Backstory: Despite being an incredibly influential and successful swimsuit model, food blogger and fashion connoisseur, Tracy doesn’t abide by society’s rules. But it’s difficult for her to go against the curve when’s she’s directly influencing it \*sigh\*. That’s why it’s so hard being super rich and successful, and that’s why Tracy wants to play on survivor. She wants to experience what real, lower-class people experience every day of their lives. She wants to hear their stories, and in turn she’ll tell hers. Incessantly.

Personality: He's basically if a frat bro had a severe case of lead singer's disease, he only cares about winning, and nothing else. He's also really misogynistic sometimes, he fails to see the worth of women a lot, but what he tells no one is that he actually wants to change, and only acts this way so that he gets a lot of public attention, and he became addicted to it and doesn't know how to stop.  
  
Backstory: Thad had it easy during his life, always with a silver spoon in his mouth, but that silver spoon came at a cost of him being the cockiest little bugger imaginable. His big mouth would get him in trouble, but he claimed he wasn't held accountable for his actions every single time he was in trouble. It didn't help his case that he would harass his brother Mitch a lot for being a lot more gentle and likable than he was. He eventually became ridiculed for his ""hood"" attitude when he lived in a rich family in a rich town, but his idiotic nature caused him to flunk out of school, and then he went to juvie for a few years for vandalizing the school. This caused him to fall in love with butt rock, believing it to be the beacon of hope for what could only be a downward spiral. Inspired by the likes of Chad Kroger and Fred Durst, he finished his time in juvie, and formed his own band with his few friends. He started incorporating rap into his butt rock songs, essentially creating a new wave of nu metal. He thought he was becoming popular, but he became the new laughing stock of the rock community. His arrogance made him think otherwise, and he still gets massive crowds of haters flocking to stadiums to boo him. He signed up for Survivor to dominate physically and to get his band the relevance he wants it to have back. His brother has his band of his own that is a lot more talented and way more popular that Thad trashes on in his song lyrics in an almost obsessive way.

Character Name: Beev Djeek

Character Nickname: Beev

Age: 44

Gender Identity: Male

Occupation: Bus Driver

Personality: Angry practically all the time, antisocial, speaks fluent caps lock

Background: Growing up, Beev wasn’t exactly the happiest fellow, as since birth, he's been unlucky. Born to an Asian mother and an Israeli father, along with his twin brother, they were planned to be named Aviv and Bhiskhat, but thanks to a typo on their birth certificates, they were instead named Beev and Bhit, and since neither of his parents had the money to legally change their names, they were just forced to go by Beev and Bhit for their whole lives. It also wasn't the best for Beev when his father ditched him, his brother, and his mother, simply because of how ugly the babies were. Beev's mother slowly but surely began to grow more angry and passive aggressive, and this led to both twins following in their mom's footsteps and becoming grouches as well, only communicating through passive agressive yelling. Beev and Bhit moved to America for a new life, and more money, but he couldn't get any good jobs, and as a result, has despised every job he's ever had, leading him to quit or be fired from practically everything. He currently works as an elementary school bus driver, but the only problem is that he hates loud kids, leading to him getting in standoffs with the pre-teens he drives around almost daily. The only perk to his job is that he has been able to manipulate a fellow bus driver to giving him his bus in a bet, which he promptly burnt in front of him because he felt like it. Playing survivor solely for the money at the end, Beev doesn't care about the social aspect of the game, and would rather hurl himself off a cliff than be 'friendly' with these people, but that wont stop him from strategizing against them, and beating them in the challenges.

Face your Manga or description: https://img.faceyourmanga.com/mangatars/2/34/2034298/large_1854577.png

Personality: Lita is an extremely giving person, and is willing to give back to her community. She puts on a rich girl act in front of others but she's in fact a minimalist and thrives with very little in front of her. She’s deadly scared of the outdoors due to always being pampered by her parents and maids. 

Back Story (Optional): Born into a rich family from Connecticut, Lita has never had to work for anything in her life (or so her father says since she was the salutatorian of her graduating class). Her father sent her out to Survivor to observe is she's worthy to take over the family business, and how well she does under pressure and around others. Lita doesn't want to take over her fathers business since it harms so many innocent people, through pollution, exploitation and horrible treatment of their employees. The only reason she is looking to takeover the family business just to sell it, and give it's profits to charity. She hates her father, and has told him that multiple times, but he doesn't listen to her. He never does. She feel alone yet she’s surrounded by many “friends” who use her as she is rich and could provide for anyone. Her mother is not any better, as she was slowly turned from a beauty queen, animal lover to a rich alcoholic and smoker who only had children in order to “provide an heir” to her husband. Lita barely has a relationship with her mom and suffers from abandonment issues due to her mother’s absence throughout her whole life. Her dream is to become a kindergarten teacher in a small town as she loves children. She would use the money she would win on survivor to give to many charities

Hello everyone, 

Thank you for taking the time to help with these issues. The information on this subreddit is incredibly helpful. 

So I am in the market for a new car. Want to get something entry level luxury and german. Looking at the GLC, C300 or a 3 series or X3. I have only visited a Mercedes dealership so far. Located in Tampa FL but moving in a week to about 4 hours away and they only have 1 dealership there.  I will be back and forth to Tampa in fall for the holidays. Looking to get something by the end of the year. 

Spoke to salesman at MB and he stated all new 2023 models coming in April next year. I thought this was a lie since usually they arrive fall of the year before the model year. He said supply chain issues causing this. Is this true?

Here is the GLC lease offer they made me. 

$0 down, $15k for my trade in ($10k owed, KBB trade in value $16,700) and $3k discount off MSRP of $48,050.00. Balance forward after everything is $43,552.42. 

Retail Payments: 60 months - $827 / 72 months - $726

Lease Payments: 36 months - $696 / 48 months - $677

What do you think?

I traded in a car at a Toyota dealer on August 1, but Capital One is still showing the amount I owed on the trade-in, along with what I owe on the new car. 

The dealer was supposed to pay off what I owed on the old car with my trade in, with the remaining balance then being subtracted from what I owe on the new car.

Tomorrow will be 2 weeks and that hasn't happened. Worse yet, I have a payment due on the old car on Tuesday, and I no longer have nor own that car, and obviously, I would rather not make a payment on a car I don't have anymore.

How long does it typically take a dealer to finish a trade in?

Yes, the relativistic kill missile is a thing - in concept, at least.

It's basically the big daddy of the orbital tungsten kinetic energy weapon, or KEW, probably being toyed around with at DARPA.

With an RKM, you accelerate aim a projectile and ramp it up to an appreciable percentage of the speed of light, giving the mass a kinetic impact equal to several hundred nuclear warheads. Planets don't dodge, and you only need to smack one so many times before it turns to rubble. Infinitely more cost-effective than a Death Star, and just the ticket for when you really, REALLY, need to be sure."

First print sales were close to a quarter of a million with subsequent years sales increasing by an order of magnitude as it spread across the Empire!

I’d say the shill are just indoctrinated into caring for their empire more than themselves. A cultural thing   rather than a biological one. Just the same as how their nobility are taught and encouraged to only care for their own noble family over literally anything else... otherwise their vast wealths would go back towards the community like they claim it does. 

Humanity would work together not only with each other but also animals to track down and hunt prey for as long as civilization has existed."

Hey, there have been reports of email phishing campaigns asking users to ""verify"" their wallet to comply with KYC regulations, along with other types of ""verification mandates"". These emails/messages are SCAMS! MetaMask wallets are NOT ASSOCIATED with user email address or personal information such as contact or bank account number. 

There’s no such thing as user verification or account verification in MetaMask. MetaMask cannot disable your wallet. Any email to that effect is a phishing scam trying to get access to your Secret Recovery Phrase to steal your funds.

Additionally, please note that MetaMask is entirely a client-side software and a self-custodial wallet: which means that, no one, not even the MetaMask team has access or control over a user's wallet or Secret Recovery Phrase. Learn more about how MetaMask's self-custody works, [here](https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360059952212-MetaMask-is-a-self-custodial-wallet). Thanks!

Okay, so first, I'm not sure how much you've done converting >!Shackled City!<, but if you're interested I've been working on a conversion at the [Series of dice based events conversion discord](https://discord.gg/Tmm9659n) or at this [google drive link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1wsyhzlOt733CuotNTaYJUqGeiBs3zFeW?usp=sharing) (though if you're just working on the final module, >!Asylum!<, I've only just completed the conversion of >!Secrets of the Soul Pillars !<so it won't be particularly useful to you)

In any case, two APL+4 encounters back to back (which is basically what this is, though of course ""back to back"" might really be ""interspersed"") is likely a bit much. You might want to use level 23 enemies (though I've never played at level 20 so I could be wrong). That is assuming you're balancing this for 4 players - if it's for 6 this is probably right on. Smaller comments:

1. The bonuses against magic should have a type - usually this would be ""+1 status to all saves vs. magic""
2. The defenses are wildly overtuned for a level 24 creature. He's got reflex just below moderate, high will, extreme fortitude, high AC and high HP in the demonic form. The net effect of the resistances and weaknesses is also to vastly increase his effective HP. Note that while you might think ""this is the big boss, he \*should\* have higher than average stats,"" remember that you've already done that in making him 23rd or 24th level. Big A should be a typical level 24 creature because \*all\* level 24 creatures should be balanced as level 24 creatures. If you want an extra powerful level 24 creature, what you really want is a level 25 creature. Creatures should be balanced for their level, otherwise you're just throwing away the math.
3. As a separate note, resistance all except X 26 is going to just invalidate a bunch of characters, which is kind of anti-fun for a final combat.
4. The immunities listed in madness should probably be listed in ""immunities"".
5. form shift: you want to phrase this as a ""DC 11 flat check"".
6. Tentacle onslaught is not phrased well. You want to say that he Strikes twice and that the multiple attack penalty increases as normal, but not until both strikes complete. That's all semantics, but what is not clear from this is what ""tries to restrain the target"" means. ""Tries to restrain"" is not a thing. Do you mean he gets a free attempt to grapple (which could result in restraining on a critical success)? Does he auto-succeed? The simple monster abilities to look at are grab and improved grab.
7. The damage is somewhat high on the reaction - about twice as high as the recommended number on unlimited abilities. But the DC is so low I'm pretty sure it's just a typo?
8. Deadly Strike. This autokills anyone who is taken to 0 by the initial damage, as written. Because as written, they go to 0, become Dying 2 because it's a crit and then the dying condition increases by 3. Is this intentional?
9. In PF2e, [Positive energy](https://2e.aonprd.com/Traits.aspx?ID=128) does not damage living creatures, which is likely all the PCs. The Angelic reaction likely doesn't do anything because the condition will never trigger (unless they're playing an undead PC)."

I am thinking about getting a new car.  I have learned that a ""lease like loan"" financing option exists, it appears mainly through credit unions.  As I understand it from the information online, it works as follows:  

1) Pick a loan term; 

2) There is a guaranteed depreciated value of the vehicle at the end of the loan term; 

3) The loan amount is the difference between the value of the vehicle at the time of purchase and future depreciated value, and your monthly payment is calculated accordingly; 

4) At the end of the loan term, you can refinance the balance (the future depreciated value), sell the car, or turn it back into the credit union for a fee.

In addition, unlike a lease, the title is in your name and there are fewer restrictions than a traditional lease.  Thus, the upside is that you pay a lower monthly payment on a vehicle you own than a traditional loan for the entire vehicle value.  The downside is there is a large amount still owed at the end of the loan period.  

Does anyone have any more information on these?  Does this sound accurate?  Any insight would be most helpful, thanks!

**Note: Scroll down to the bottom to skip the story and some details, in order to find the questions.**

Hello! I’m looking for the best way to proceed after a case of Buyer’s Remorse.

We purchased a certified pre-owned SUV with 53,000 miles on it from AutoNation on Saturday. The subtotal of the car was about $32,000 after taxes. Then, we purchased the Total Care warranty vehicle service contract (VSC) for about $3,500. That brought us to about $35,500 total; then, we put $15,500 down.

Unfortunately, my wife already wants something else. We will look to order a new vehicle directly from our desired manufacturer, thereby paying MSRP for it. *We’ll need this car while we wait for the next one, so returning the car within AutoNation’s worry-free return period isn’t an option*.

If we go down this route, we’ll need to clean up the mess of the current AutoNation loan. We owe approximately $20,000 on the loan. $16,500 for car and $3,500 when VSC is considered.

* I know we can cancel the warranty/VSC. If we cancel the VSC, will it be reflected on the total loan amount? For example, if we cancel the VSC at a good time, would we then owe $20,000 minus the pro rata valuation of the VSC?
* What’s the best time to cancel so that the salesman and the finance manager can receive credit? 
   * We worked with a friend. He worked hard, and I want to be sure he and the finance manager get credit. *I don’t want them to be penalized for our buyer’s remorse, and I’m willing to lose money because of our own short-sightedness*.
* What would our best course of action be regarding loan payoff on the AutoNation vehicle? 
   * If we trade it into our new car's manufacturer, will they sort out the remaining balance of that loan? 
   * Should we attempt to sell the car to CarMax/Carvana, then use that cash as a down payment for the new vehicle instead?
* Is there any way to estimate how much money we'll lose in all this mess?

Thanks in advance for the help! I truly appreciate it.

I traded in a car on Monday for a newer car. I have a payment on the old car due on August 16th. Capital One still shows that old car balance in my account, and separately, they show my balance owned on the newer car.

The dealer is supposed to use my trade-in to pay off the old car balance and use the rest to apply towards the new car balance. I don't know the timetables of these things, but that hasn't happened, and it's a concern with a payment due on the old car in 9 days. Nothing is owed on the new car until September 15.

The lender will see the unbalanced account and refund you the payment. 2) cancel/stop the payment and suffer the phone calls and such about you being late. They threaten repo and all that (for a car you don’t have) and it gets super annoying. Never sure how these show on credit, but I’ve never been in a position and done it myself. Eventually the left hand and right hand get together and the account is closed in full and all is good.

The first option takes money out of your account for a time (like a couple weeks). The second runs the risk of credit issues and collections type calls.

Your decision."

>how these scamming methods work

The main scam is based on how US banks process checks.  When you deposit one (either in person or mobile), the bank will make the money available within a couple days, but it can actually take many more days to weeks for the various banks to communicate with each other behind the scenes and verify that the account number on the check exists and that there's money in it.  In the meantime, you've got the money in your account and it looks like the payment has cleared.  

The next part of the scam is that this check will usually be for *way* more than you agreed on, and the scammer will suddenly start insisting that you send the extra money back because [insert sad story here].  You think the payment has cleared, so you send the extra back to the scammer.  Days or weeks later, the bank will realize the check was fake and will take the money back out of your account.  *All of it*.  Plus an extra bounced check fee.  That money you sent the scammer ends up being from your own funds, possibly putting your account in the negative when all is said and done.


The other stuff about paypal is just them trying their luck once you rejected the check.  There is no extra layer to the scam, they were just going to keep your $500 (and probably keep asking for more for made up reasons until you block them)."

* Very few people under maybe 30 years old use checks anymore. If your artwork doesn't appeal to old people, checks are suspicious.
* That being said, mobile checks could still be possible, and I myself don't know many international methods of transferring money that are available, despite having done some research on this topic recently.
* They stated that they could only use check (that is, they could not use paypal) and then later said they can use paypal. Blatant lies.
* When confirming that you have the right account number for sending money over the internet (like Paypal), typically people will send something like 0.21 USD, not 500 USD, and then the receiver will return those 0.21 USD.
* ""45489541.33"" USD is 45 million dollars. If they have that much money, they're an important person that you can find on the internet. The average person (very vague definition of ""average"" of course) won't have more than 20000 USD in a single bank account.

He didn't mention what he wanted commissioned or any of my art. And on top of all, that the prick acted like he was doing me some kind of favor, like I was a 24 hour dial-a-painting commission service desperately in need of business.

Let's just dispel the myth right here, there are not rich guys cruising Reddit looking to commission art from anonymous Redditors. 

What he do have, however, is plenty of these dipshit wannabe con artists scanning our art subs every day looking for suckers. This numbnuts probably sent out 100 DMs just like the one he sent me and isn't even trying to keep up with everyone he messaged, only the ones who respond.

My friend traded in one of his paid off cars as a down payment on a newer car at a used car lot.  

3 days later the engine failed on the new car (high miles, previous owner installed performance mods, etc…)

The used car lot said they’d split the engine replacement 50/50 with my friend, he said “ok.”

Fast forward 7 months (my friend has been making payments on a car he doesn’t have) and the dealership has decided that even splitting the repair 50/50 is too expensive for them.  So the decided they would pay off his loan balance, reimburse him on my monthly payments to date, and call it even.

They’re not going to pay him for his trade in or give him a car of equal value.  Just “f-off and go away.”

What can he do?

[Mind smith](https://2e.aonprd.com/Archetypes.aspx?ID=194) and [Soulforger](https://2e.aonprd.com/Archetypes.aspx?ID=102) are the two big ones.

The spell closest to your wishes otherwise is spiritual weapon"

5e loves its vertical boosts; that is, raw damage boosts that add dice or modifiers to your attack rolls. In 2e, damage is more heavily capped. Any weapon you make with an equivalent spell can't just outdamage actual weapons, because the game isn't designed with that sort of raw vertical power boost.

What you'd do instead is likely have it play with peripheral elements; things like dealing with non-standard damage types, granting unusual traits to it that most weapons wouldn't, inflicting conditions under certain circumstances, etc. That's what you'd want to do for such a spell."

As such the blade it would make would be similar to having a normal, runed weapon (d8, or d6 with finesse, or possibly a 2-handed d10 option) with a +1 item bonus if cast as a 2nd level spell, +1 striking as 3rd level, etc. (Edit: but also last longer then Magic Weapon, possibly out to a full day like Mage Armor)

It probably shouldn't be stronger than that as you can likely run away with damage under certain conditions, mostly with a Magus. Then, for anyone except a Magus, it won't work that great as casters have bad weapon proficiency and martials would lag a few caster levels behind. At that point... it may as well become a Magus class feat/focus spell or the sort. I don't really see a way of making it worthwhile for a normal martial without being too strong on a Magus, though for full casters you could essentially go the Spiritual Weapon/Imaginary Weapon route and use the spellcasting modifier.

Other things that could give you similar flavor would be [Spiritual Weapon](https://2e.aonprd.com/Spells.aspx?ID=306), the new Psychic cantrip [Imaginary Weapon](https://2e.aonprd.com/Spells.aspx?ID=1142) (with the Tangible Dream mind, also possible through an archetype), or the [Soulforger](https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=1560) archetype. None of these is quite the same though."
